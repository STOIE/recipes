Preparing a new cast iron:

1. Grind all inside surfaces and the bottom of the pan to as close of a mirror finish as possible. This may be done with a combination of sanding discs on an angle grinder, electric sander and manual hand sanding. The higher the polish and more even and smooth the surface, the better the pan will work.


Seasoning:

1. Rub down every surface (inside and out) of the cast iron with flax-seed oil, then remove any excess with a dry cloth. Place the pan upside-down into a hot oven (on the highest possible setting) for 60 mins until the oil has well and truly smoked off. This process should be repeated around 4 times, with the final bake going for 3 hours duration.

Note. if the cast iron is sticky and not like the texture of glass when removed from the oven, it's either because it needs to be baked for longer, or you have used too much oil - or both.

OR

1. Cook the skins of two large potatoes in a cup of salt and a cup of flax-seed oil on high heat until the skins are crisp beyond eating.

Note. to do the outside of the pan use the oven method once or twice to the outside of the pan (the salt method results in a harder wearing seasoning for the inside of the pan to resist scratching from steel utensils).


Cleaning:

1. Add cheap salt to the pan, scrub with a wooden spoon and/or firm brush and then wash in warm (not hot) water, NO SOAP and wipe down with clean paper towel.
1. Place back onto the stove and heat until all moisture is gone, then adding a light coating of flax-seed oil rubbed into the inside of the pan quickly with paper towel, brought to smoke point and then removed from heat and let cool before putting away.
