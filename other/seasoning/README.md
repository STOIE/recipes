Seasoning:

Cook the skins of two large potatoes in a cup of salt and a cup of flax oil on high heat until the skins are crisp beyond eating.


Cleaning:

1. Add cheap salt to the pan, scrub with a wooden spoon and/or firm brush and then wash in warm (not hot) water, NO SOAP and wipe down with clean paper towel.
1. Place back onto the stove and heat until all moisture is gone, then adding a tablespoon of flax oil rubbed in quickly with paper towel, brought to smoke point and then removed from heat to cool before putting away.
