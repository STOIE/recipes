Preparing a new cast iron:

1. Grind all inside surfaces and the bottom of the pan to as close of a mirror finish as possible. This may be done with a combination of sanding discs on an angle grinder, electric sander and manual hand sanding. The higher the polish and more even and smooth the surface, the better the pan will work.


Seasoning:

1. Rub down every surface (inside and out) of the cast iron with flax-seed oil, then remove any excess with a dry cloth. Place the pan upside-down into a hot oven (on the highest possible setting) for 45-60 mins until the oil has well and truly smoked off. This process should be repeated around 4 times.
1. Then, cook the skins of two large potatoes in a cup of salt and a cup of flax-seed oil on high heat until the skins are crisp beyond eating.


Cleaning:

1. Add cheap salt to the pan, scrub with a wooden spoon and/or firm brush and then wash in warm (not hot) water, NO SOAP and wipe down with clean paper towel.
1. Place back onto the stove and heat until all moisture is gone, then adding a tablespoon of flax-seed oil rubbed in quickly with paper towel, brought to smoke point and then removed from heat to cool before putting away.
