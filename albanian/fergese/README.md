#### Ingredients

* 500 grams cheese curd
* 300 grams beef meat (or without as you please)
* 1 large onion diced fine
* 1-1.5 whole garlics (full size) diced fine
* 6 red banana chillies cut into small-medium sized chunks
* 2 green banana chillies cut into small-medium sized chunks
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 8 tablespoons of olive oil
* 1 tablespoons corn flour
* 1/2 tablespoon plain flour
* 2 large tomatoes
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 teaspoon salt
* Chilli (seeds or fresh) to your liking
* 3 teaspoons of red paprika
* More water than you might think


#### Method

1. In a large deep pan on high heat cook the onion within the olive oil.
1. Then add meat (if using), tomatoes, chilli, pepper and salt.
1. You may need to initially add a splash of water to prevent everything sticking, but keep mixing continiously until the tomatoes begin to release juice into the bottom of the pan and boiling begins.
1. Once they're stewing, reduce the heat to half and lid the pan, leave cooking until the tomatoes are falling apart.
1. Remove this from heat into a big bowl.
1. Quickly clean the pan and then melt the butter with the garlic and fry lightly, not burning the butter.
1. Once the butter is fully melted and the garlic cooked (do not overcook it), add the red paprika, remove the pan from heat and mix it all through.
1. Return the pan to the heat and add all of the banana chillies, lower the heat and add a decent splash of water.
1. Cook on medium heat with the lid on the pan.
1. While the banana chillies are cooking, mix the corn and plain flour mix into a 1/3 of a cup of water until no lumps remain.
1. Add the flour mix into the bowl we cooked earlier (with the tomatoes +meat) and mix through.
1. Once the banana chillies are softened (not mush) turn the heat down to very low.
1. Then combine the tomato +meat mix cooked earlier into the panand mix it through.
1. Now add the curd and mix throughly.
1. Once mixed, place the mixture into small ceramic pots about 2/3 full and add a light drizzle of olive oil to the top of each pot.
1. Place into a cold oven, turned onto 180 deg C and cook until bubbling and starting to brown ontop.
1. Remove from the oven and serve immediately (it will be very hot, but enjoyed best when hot).
1. Cook without burning the top and not drying out, but browned slightly on top and boiling.
