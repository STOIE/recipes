When selecting yoghurt, you can select a thicker yoghurt than the cosistency desired provided the yoghurt is not sweet, this is fine. You can then add water (and/or milk) to the yoghurt mixing through to achieve the desired consistency.


#### Method

1. Wash the cucumber and grate finely with a grater.
1. Chop across the lengths of shredded cucumber to make them into very fine dices.
1. In a medium-large sized mixing bowl add the yoghurt, olive oil and garlic.
1. Mix together while slowly adding in the cucumber, then pepper and salt until all throughly mixed through.
