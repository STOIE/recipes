## No. 7: Chicken - prawn

### Protein Prep

#### Ingredients

* 1kg boneless chicken, cut into ~5mm slices
* 1 tablespoon baking soda (bicarbonate soda) - not baking powder!
* 1kg prawns (weighed whole), heads removed (set aside in fridge), deveined and shelled
* 3 cloves garlic, smashed
* 1 inch ginger, sliced
* 1 inch turmeric, sliced (else, 1 teaspoon ground)
* 1 stalk lemongrass
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 2 tablespoons fish sauce

#### Method

1. In a bowl add the chicken and the baking soda, mix well and allow to sit for 60 minutes.
1. Throughout the 60 minutes, if you remember, mix a few additional times, to ensure everything is coated well.
1. Wash the chicken in a strainer to remove any remaining baking soda.
1. Pound the tumeric, garlic, ginger and lemongrass altogether to a paste in a mortar and set aside.
1. Mix the paste with the salt and fish sauce into the chicken in a bowl.
1. Allow to marinade for 2+ hours (best in the fridge overnight).
