## Mac and Cheese

### Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 3 cups water
* 4 cups milk
* 400 grams macaroni pasta
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon fine garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon mustard powder
* 4-5 cups of fine grated cheddar cheese
* 1/2 cup of fine grated parmigiano reggiano


### Method

1. Melt butter in a large-deep pot over medium-high heat.
1. Add flour, and stir until combined.
1. Then pour in 1 cup of the water, and stir until the mixture is completely smooth and begins to thicken.
1. Gradually pour in the remaining water and milk, stirring until evenly combined.
1. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, mustard and then pasta until combined.
1. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the mixture just reaches a simmer.
1. Reduce heat to medium-low to maintain the low simmer.
1. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, for about 9-10 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente (or to your liking).
1. Remove from heat and allow to cool significantly, then stir in the cheeses until melted (adding it too hot will cause the cheese to become grainy).
1. Serve hot immediately.
