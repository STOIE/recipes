# Complex Miso

### Ingredients

* 2 cups tomatoes (diced)
* 1/4 cup sesame oil
* 1 leek (sliced)
* 1-1/2 cups shiitake mushrooms (sliced)
* 6 cups vegetable broth
* 2 tbsp. diced wakame seaweed or other seaweed
* 1 package silken soft tofu (cubed)
* 1 tbsp. soy sauce
* 3 tbsp. miso
* 2 scallions or green onions (sliced)


### Method

1. In a large pot, saute the tomatoes, leek, and mushroom for 1 to 3 minutes.
1. Add the vegetable broth and seaweed and bring to a slow simmer. Add the tofu, soy sauce (or the gluten-free tamari or Nama Shoyu if you're doing the gluten-free version), and the miso and scallions and reduce the heat to low.
1. Stir well to dissolve and mix the miso.
1. Allow to cook for at least 8 more minutes over low heat (never let it boil !!!).

Note. Miso should NEVER be allowed to boil, it can instantly destroy the dish.
