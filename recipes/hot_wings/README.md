# Wings

### Ingredients

* 1 kg chicken wings (cut into individual pieces, cut at the joints)
* 1 (148ml) bottle Franks Redhot Original sauce
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter


### Method

1. Add the Franks sauce to a sauce pan with the butter.
1. Melt slowly without burning.
1. Once melted, remove from heat (if you let cool, it can be added to a sauce bottle for multiple uses).
1. Prepare a deep fryer (temp is when a wooden skewer inserted into the oil, forms bubbles around it).
1. Dry the chicken wing pieces with paper towel.
1. In batches, fry the wings in the oil (no batter necessary) for 13 minutes.
1. After cooking, remove and place onto a rack for excess oil to drip off.
1. Finally, in a large bowl - add the wings and coat thoroughly with the hot-sauce.
1. Once coated, serve hot with a sauce (like the blue cheese sauce below).

Note. Serve hot with sauce like [Blue Cheese Sauce](../sauces/).
