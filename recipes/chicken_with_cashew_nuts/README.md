#### Ingredients

##### Main

* 400 grams chicken thigh fillet, cut into medallions
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
* 2 teaspoons cornflour
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 3 slices ginger, bruised
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
* 1 small brown onion, peeled and cut into 3cm chunks
* 1/2 red capsicum, cut into 3cm chunks
* 1/2 yellow capsicum, cut into 3cm chunks
* 1/2 green capsicum, cut into 3cm chunks
* 1/2 cup unsalted roasted cashew nuts

##### Sauce

* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
* 1 tablespoon white vinegar
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1/4 cup chicken stock or water


#### Method

1. Combine the sauce ingredients and set aside. Combine the chicken with the remaining 1 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine and 1 tsp of the cornflour and mix well to coat the chicken.
1. Heat the wok over high heat until very hot and add 2 tbsp of oil around its edge, letting it run down into the centre of the wok. Add the ginger and then the garlic and toss for about 30 seconds until the garlic is browned, add the chicken and fry, tossing the wok occasionally until the chicken is browned and barely cooked through. Remove the chicken from the wok and set aside.
1. Return the wok to the heat and add the additional 1 tbsp of oil. Add the onion and capsicum and toss the wok until the capsicum begins to soften. Add the sauce ingredients and bring the sauce to a simmer. Return the chicken to the wok, add the sauce, stir and bring to a simmer. Combine the remaining cornflour with 2 tbsp of cold water. Drizzle in the cornflour mixture until the contents of the wok are thickened to a silky consistency. Toss through the cashews and serve.
