## Chimichanga

### Prerequisites

* Chicken or Beef prepared and shredded as you would for tacos
* Refried beans (see recipe)
* Cooked generic long-grain rice (else, jasmine or basmati, but the falvour will be off)

### Ingredients

* 1kg beef loin (or flank, or round) thinly sliced into 2mm sections
* 1/2 teaspoon papain meat tenderiser (or sodium carbonate, or microwave bi-carbonate for 1 minute)
* 1/3 cup water
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1-1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
* 1-1/2 tablespoon shaoxing wine
* 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 1-1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
* Another volume of vegetable oil to pass thru

#### Method

1. Mix the papain into the meat and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
1. Mix cornstarch into shaoxing wine to make a slurry.
1. Then mix all the ingredients (including slurry) together with the beef, mixing well.
1. Allow to rest for 1-6 hours.
1. Then heat a wok to high heat with a reasonable volume of oil.
1. Once very hot, pass the meat through the oil for a very brief fry (60-90 seconds).
1. It should change colour, then remove and drain, setting the beef aside.
