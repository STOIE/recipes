## Vanilla Buttercream Frosting

#### Equipment

* Mixer


#### Ingredients

* 230 grams unsalted butter (warm room temperature and very soft)
* 500 grams icing sugar (sifted to remove any lumps)
* 60 ml heavy cream (warm room temperature)
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* decent sized pinch of salt


#### Method

1. In your mixer with a paddle attachment, add the butter and beat on medium speed until creamy (around 2 minutes).
1. Add the icing sugar, cream, vanilla and salt to the mixer bowl.
1. Initially beat on low speed for about 30 seconds until incorporated, then increase speed to high for around 2 minutes.
1. At this point you can thicken or thin the mixture by adding either more icing sugar (thicker) or cream (thinner) until the desired texture is reached.
