# Beef

## Ribs

### Meat Prep

#### Ingredients

* 1.5-1.7kg 3-ribs rack
* 50:50 salt:ground black pepper (by volume)

#### Method

1. On the back-side of the ribs, score the membrane with a criss-cross pattern.
1. On the top-side, trim any fat thicker than 2mm from the surface of the ribs (the more the meat is exposed the better it will gain smoke flavour).
1. Set aside the fat to make smoked tallow later in the process.

### Cooking

#### Method

1. Get your smoker to 110 deg C (225 deg F), then place the chickens inside.
1. Cook for ~2 hours at temp.
1. Raise the temp to 165 deg C (325 deg F) - either by moving closer to firebox, onto another shelf and/or stoking the fire.
1. Open the chimney damper up and firebox door open to get maximum airflow that will dry and crisp the chicken skin and reder the fat.
1. After ~15 mins skin should be crispy and colour golden brown, check internal temp of the breast to 75 deg C (165 deg F).
1. Remove from the smoker.
