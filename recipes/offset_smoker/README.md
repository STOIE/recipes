## Ribs

### Meat Prep

#### Ingredients

* 1.5-1.7kg 3-ribs rack
* 50:50 salt:ground black pepper (by volume)

#### Method

1. On the back-side of the ribs, score the membrane with a criss-cross pattern.
1. On the top-side, trim any fat thicker than 5mm from the surface of the ribs.

### Cooking

#### Method

1. Get your smoker to 200 deg F, then place the ribs inside, thickest bone-end facing the firebox inside.
1. Cook for ~4-6 hours at temp, with a smoky fire (but open flame), rotate as the bones pull-in (internal temp ~175).
1. Raise the temp to 250 deg F, keeping a fairly smoky fire (but open flame) and cook a further 1-2 hours (internal temp ~190).
1. Remove from the smoker, wrap in butcher paper - optionally placing some smoked-tallow on the top-side of the ribs.
1. Place back into the smoker and increase temp to 275 deg F clean fire and cook until the temp probe goes into the meat like peanut butter (internal temp ~195-200).
1. Place into an insulated cooler to rest for a couple of hours.
