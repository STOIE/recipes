# Crispy Pork Belly

## Fried Pieces

### Prep

#### Ingredients

* 1kg pork belly
* 3-1/2 tablespoons fish sauce
* 2-1/2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
* 4-1/2 tablespoons plain flour
* 4-1/2 tablespoons cornstarch

#### Method

1. Remove the skin from the pork belly and then slice into 30mm wide strips, and then into 15mm slices from those strips, adding to a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the fish sauce, sugar and white pepper to the bowl and mix through thoroughly (by hand) until all the sauce is soaked by the pork and coated evenly.
1. In a small bowl, add the plain flour and cornstarch, then mix them together until combined.
1. Next add the flour mixture to the pork, again mixing thoroughly until all the pork is evenly coated with a light coating.

### Cooking

#### Method

1. In a deep-frying vessel (generally a wok), add about 1-1/2 inches of oil and bring to frying temp, around 175 deg C.
1. Then fry the pork (in one-quarter batches at a time) for exactly 2 minutes, removing each batch before adding the next and placing onto a wire rack.
1. Once fried, turn off the fryer and allow the pork to cool for 10-20 minutes.
1. Then, bring your fryer up to 195 deg C for a second fry.
1. Add the pork to the fryer again in batches, and fry for 90 seconds, once cooked, remove and let rest on the wire rack again.
1. Allow 2-5 minutes to cool and then serve.

Note. Nam Jim Jeaw is a perfect sauce to acompany the pork.
