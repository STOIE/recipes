### Crema Pasticcera

#### Ingredients

* 700ml full-cream milk (split into 550ml / 150ml in two bowls)

* 6 egg yolks
* 150 grams white caster sugar
* 60 grams cake flour
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 60 grams chopped dark chocolate (not baking chocolate)

#### Method

1. Add the 550ml of milk and lemon zest to a medium saucepan.
1. Heat over medium heat until you can see steam rising from the milk, but DO NOT BOIL - then remove from heat and set aside.
1. In a bowl whish together the egg yolks, sugar and flour until smooth, then whisk in the remaining milk.
1. Remove the lemon zest from the warm milk and discard, before whisking the warm milk into the egg mixture, followed by the vanilla extract.
1. Pour all the mixture back into the saucepan and place over medium heat, whisking continuously. 
1. The mixture should boil and thicken, then simmer for 1 minute and remove from heat - do not stop stiring ever.
1. Quickly evenly divide the hot mixture into two bowls, adding the chocolate to one and stiring it through until melted and combined.
1. Then immediately cover the bowls with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface to avoid a skin forming.
1. Refridgerate and then stir until smooth before using - can be kept in the fridge if making in advance.

### Frosting and Decorating

#### Ingredients

* 500ml heavy whipping cream
* 16 grams (2 tablespoons) icing sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 150 grams (1-1/2 cups) sliced almonds

#### Method

1. Place the cream into your mixer bowl with a whisk attachment and whip on medium speed.
1. While whipping, slowly add in the sugar and vanilla extract.
1. Whip until solid peaks form, but do not over whip.
1. Refridgerate until needed.
1. Preheat your oven to 180 celsius.
1. Spread the almonds evenly over a tray lined with baking paper and place into the oven.
1. Bake for around 8 minutes until lightly browned, then remove and set aside to cool.

#### Assembly

1. Take an appropriately sized cake board.
1. Starting with the bottom layer of the cake, place it onto the board.
1. Pour the rum syrup over the layer fairly heavily to let soak in.
1. Then, apply one thick layer of the crema pasticcera to the bottom layer of the cake.
1. Next, place the second layer of the cake atop it, pressing down on the layer to make it stick to the other.
1. Now add more rum syrup, followed by another thick layer of the other colour crema pasticcera.
1. Continue to add layers and rum/crema pasticcera in alternating chocolate / white layers, until you place on the top layer of the cake - noting that if you have only 3 layers, you are already done!
1. On the top layer, add rum, but do NOT add crema pasticcera!
1. Once assembled, coat the sides of the cake with a layer of crema pasticcera, this will allow the almonds to stick.
1. Next, slightly tilt the cake while applying the almonds on the outside of the cake with the palm of your hand.
1. Finally, add the cream to the top of the cake and smooth out with a spatula into a thick layer.

Note. you can also pipe cream onto the top of the cake in any manner you desire, as well as adding cherries or more almonds to the top of the cake.
