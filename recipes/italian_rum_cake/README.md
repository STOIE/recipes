### Crema Pasticcera

#### Ingredients

* 700ml full-cream milk
* 1 long strip of lemon zest (2cm wide)
* 6 egg yolks
* 150 grams white caster sugar
* 60 grams cake flour
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 60 grams chopped dark chocolate (not baking chocolate)

#### Method

1. Preheat your oven to 180 celsius.
1. In your mixer bowl, add egg whites and cream of tartar.
1. Using a whisk attachment, beat on high till foamy.
1. Then add the 90 grams of sugar to the mixer bowl and continue to beat on high until firm peaks form.
1. Remove mixture from the mixing bowl and place into another large bowl.
1. Give the mixer bowl a quick clean and then add the egg yolks, the 160g of sugar, salt, water, honey and vanilla to the bowl.
1. Beat on high until fluffy, pale yellow ribbons form (ribbon, when the mixture falls onto itself a ribbon should remain for 3-4 seconds).
1. Then add approx half of the egg white mixture into the bowl and gently fold in with a silicone spatula.
1. Using a sieve, sift the flour and baking powder into the egg yolk mixture in 3-5 parts, gently folding the mixture after each addition.
1. Next add the vegetable oil into the mixture, slowly adding while gently folding through.
1. Finally add the remaining half of the egg whites to the mixture and fold through until well combined, trying to to deflate the mixture.

#### Baking

1. Line your cake tin with parchment paper along the sides and bottom.
1. Pour the mixture into the tin gently and then tap the tin on the benchtop twice to break any large bubbles.
1. Bake for around 45+ minutes, until golden brown with a raised centre - a wooden skewer inserted in the middle of the cake should come out dry to ensure properly cooked.
1. Once baking is complete, remove immediately from the tin and place upside down onto a cooling rack (do not attempt to flip back over).
