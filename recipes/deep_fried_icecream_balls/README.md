### Ingredients (makes 6 servings)

* 2 pints ice cream
* 2x 11-ounce pound cake loaves
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 egg
* 1 cup cold water

### Method

1. Scoop out 6 balls of ice cream onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and freeze for at least an hour, or until firm.
1. Slice pound cake into 1-2 inch slices.
1. Lay three slices of pound cake on plastic wrap side by side and flatten with a rolling pin.
1. Wrap frozen ice cream ball in pound cake so it’s fully enclosed. Freeze for at least an hour, or until firm.
1. Make tempura batter by mixing flour, egg, and water.
1. Heat oil to 200˚C (or when an inserted wooden skewer begins to bubble).
1. Coat the wrapped ice cream in tempura batter.
1. Carefully lower the coated ice cream into the oil and cook until golden brown, 15-30 seconds. Don’t cook for too long or else the ice cream will melt.
1. Serve immediately with your toppings of choice.
