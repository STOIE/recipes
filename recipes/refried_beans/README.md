## Refried Beans

### Ingredients

* 500 grams pinto beans
* 2 tablespoons lard or tallow (else oil)
* 1/2 white onion, sliced into fine slices
* 1 jalapeno, sliced into long quarters
* 1 cup bean broth
* 1 cup grated mexican cheese, like Queso Asadero


### Method

1. Prepare the pinto beans, by cooking for 45 minutes in a pressure cooker, then allowing to rest for a further 30 minutes.
1. Provided the beans are cooked soft, remove them from the cooker, separating the beans from the broth (keeping the broth).
1. Then, take a large frying pan and add the lard, along with the jalapeno and onion.
1. Fry until fragrant, then add the beans into the pan.
1. After adding the beans add the 1 cup of bean broth to the pan.
1. Once simmering, taste and add salt if required.
1. Then lightly blend the beans using an immersion blender (or masher), you can go as smooth or chunky as you desire.
1. Continue to simmer for around 5 minutes, until the desired consistency is met, simmering for longer if a dried paste is desired.
1. Turn off the heat, allow to cool for 5 minutes and then add the cheese, stirring it in.
