# Zucchini Balls

#### Ingredients

*Makes approx 10-12 large ~6cm balls*

* 500-625 grams (4-5 cups) course grated zucchini (ends removed, unpeeled)
* 160 grams (1 cup) crumbled feta cheese
* 25 grams (1/4 cup) fresh mint, finely chopped
* 180 grams (1-1/2 cups) self-rising flour
* 2 large eggs, beaten
* 3 green onions, finely sliced
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon fine black pepper
* vegetable oil for deep frying


#### Method

* Mix the grated zucchini with salt and place into a colander in the sink and allow to drain for 20 minutes.
* Gently squeeze the zucchini with your hands a few times to remove excess water.
* Then mix all the ingredients, less the flour, thoroughly, for large batches you can use a stand mixer.
* Once combined, slowly add the flour in to form a wet dough.
* Using a large serving spoon and a regular soup spoon, roughly ball the mix into large ~6cm balls while dropping into the deep fryer oil.
* Cook well, until very brown and bubbling has very much settled.
* Remove and place on a paper lined plate or rack to drain excess oil.
* Serve hot with [garlic sauce](../sauces/).
