## Octopus

### Ingredients

### Method

1. Remove the outer layer from the cabbage and then chop into quarters and remove the core
1. Slice the entire cabbage against the grain into slices and place into large bowl.
1. Sprinkle the salt over the cabbage, and then using a gloved hand, massage the salt into the cabbage.
1. This is a time consuming process, do so for around 10 minutes, kneading it through.
1. The cabbage should release a lot of liquid.


## Cooking

### Ingredients

* 3 full scallions, sliced very fine (can use only greens if you have)
* 1-2 tablespoon beni-shoga, diced fine (optional)

1. Pour about 1/3 of the batter evenly into the pan.
1. Sprinkle over 2/3 of the scallions and all the ingredients (less octopus).
1. Pour the remaining batter over the pan evenly.
1. Then add the octopus to each takoyaki.
1. Allow to cook for a moment, before using a wooden skewer to slice between each takoyaki to seperate them.
1. Allow to cook more, and then using the skewer in a scooping motion to push the corners into the balls and then partially turn the balls.
