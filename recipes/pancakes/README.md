# Thick fluffy pancakes

### Ingredients (makes 12 pancakes)

* 4 cups self-raising flour and 2 teaspoons baking powder (or 4 cups plain flour and 3 tablespoons baking powder)
* 3 eggs
* 3-1/2 cups full-fat milk
* 1/2 cup white sugar 
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)


### Method (takes min. 2 hours - or overnight)

#### Batter

1. Sift the flour and baking powder together into a large bowl and stir through the sugar to combine.
1. Make a well in the centre.
1. Mix the egg, milk and vanilla together and pour into the well.
1. Whisk with a spatula to slowly incorporate the dry ingredients together with the wet until just barely combined.
1. Then add the egg whites and stir slightly more.
1. Put the mixture through a sieve and into a container, to remove any excess lumps.
1. Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours (preferably overnight).


#### Cooking

1. Heat a non-stick pan (or plate) over low-medium heat (cast iron is best). *DONâ€™T ADD ANY BUTTER OR OIL TO THE PAN*
1. Add a half cup of batter and allow to cook for 4-5 minutes.
1. When the pancake is golden brown and the uncooked surface is covered with bubbles, flip the pancake and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, wiggling the top of the pancake with your fingers to see if the batter inside is cooked.
1. Repeat for the remaining batter.



# Thickest, fluffiest pancakes

### Ingredients

* 2-12 cups all-purpose flour
* 3 tablespoons white sugar
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2-1/2 cups buttermilk
* 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted (+more for cooking and serving)
* 2 eggs, whites and yolks separated
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for serving
* Blueberries, optional
* Chocolate chips, optional
* Maple syrup, for serving


### Method

#### Batter

1. In a large bowl, add the flour (spoon and cut when measuring, be precise and don't compact the flour), sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk to combine.
1. In a medium bowl or liquid measuring cup, add the buttermilk, melted butter, and egg yolks and whisk to combine.
1. Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients and gently fold with a rubber spatula until just combined.
1. Add the egg whites and fold until just combined. Be sure not to overmix. Some lumps are okay (GOOD even!).
1. Let the batter rest for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.


#### Cooking

1. Add another tablespoon of butter to a cast iron skillet and heat over medium-low heat.
1. Once the butter has melted and is bubbling, reduce the heat to medium-low and add 1/3 of a cup of batter to the pan.
1. (If adding any toppings like chocolate chips or blueberries, sprinkle over the pancake now).
1. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until bubbles start to appear on the surface.
1. Flip the pancake over and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown.
1. Repeat with the remaining batter.
1. Serve the pancakes with butter and maple syrup.
