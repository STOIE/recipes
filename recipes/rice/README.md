# Plain Basmati Rice

### Method

1. Take your rice and place into a pot/container and wash thoroughly.
1. Once water is running clear, add some salt and fill the container with the rice with cold water and allow the rice to sit for 15-30 minutes in the water.
1. Fill a large-tall pot with water about 2/3rds of the way, add a decent amount of salt and olive oil to the water.
1. Place the pot on the stove, high heat and bring to a rolling boil.
1. Add the rice to the boiling water and allow to cook in a rolling boil, stirring as it goes (decreasing heat if necessary).
1. Cook the rice until it no longer sticks in your teeth, however before it is totally cooked, still a little al-dente.
1. Remove to a strainer in the sink and immediately rinse with cold running water to stop the rice cooking.
1. The clean the pot and add some more oil to the bottom of the pot.
1. Place the rice into the pot in a pyramid shape, not touching the sides of the pot and shy of the top (if the pile is taller than the top, then your pot is too small).
1. Once all in the pot and a pyramid achieved, get a spoon handle and poke a hole down through the centre of the pryamid and then more around the middle down through the pile.
1. Then wrap the pot lid in a towel and place it over the pot, placing the pot back on the stove over low-heat.
1. If the pot starts visibly steaming from the outside, lower the heat a little further, however some sizzling of the rice is normal.
1. After about 15-20 minutes, the rice should be steaming inside the pot, at this point add a good-sized drizzle of olive oil to the rice and place the lid back on.
1. Continue to cook for another 15-25 minutes until the steam has reduced and the rice is fluffy.

1. When plating the plain basmati rice above, add some rice to a bowl and add some saffron water to the rice, mix it through and add to the top of the pile of rice for serving.
