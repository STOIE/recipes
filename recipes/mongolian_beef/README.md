### Ingredients

* 1kg flank steak, sliced 1/4 inch thick against the grain
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 teaspoon minced ginger
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon chilli flakes
* 1 stalk green onion, sliced for garnish


### Method

In a large ziplock bag add the sliced flank steak and cornstarch. Toss the beef to coat evenly. Heat a large skillet to high heat and add the vegetable oil. Once heated, add the steak in a single layer and cook on each side for about a minute until the edges just start to brown. Once the steak is cooked, remove and set aside on a plate.
In a small mixing bowl combine soy sauce, brown sugar, water, ginger, and garlic. Add the sauce to the pan and bring to a boil. Add the steak to the sauce and allow the sauce to thicken for a couple of minutes. Toss with the chopped green onions and sprinkle with red pepper flakes.
