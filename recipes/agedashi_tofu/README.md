## Agedashi Tofu

Portion, main for three adults.

#### Ingredients

* 900-1000 grams tofu, cut into 2x2x1 inch blocks
* 8 tablespoon potato starch
* 500ml dashi stock
* 60ml light soy sauce
* 60ml mirin
* 1500-2000ml vegetable oil for frying

#### Optional Toppings

* dried bonito flakes
* 2 green scallions, cut into thin rounds
* 5cm daikon radish, grated

#### Method

1. Thoroughly dry the tofu blocks with paper towel, pressing all excess water out.
1. Coat the tofu blocks in the cornstarch to form a very light dry-batter-dusting.
1. Heat your preferred deep frying vessel, with the oil to temperature.
1. Place the dashi (plus water if using powder), soy sauce and mirin into a saucepan over medium heat (shutting off the heat once a boil is reached).
1. Begin frying your tofu blocks, until they form a nice light crust (avoid over-cooking, they should NOT turn brown).
1. Strain excess oil off the tofu blocks as you remove from the oil.
1. Once all the blocks are cooked and the soup boiled, plate up and garnish as desired.
