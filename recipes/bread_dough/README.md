# Plain White Loaf

## Phase 1 - Mixing (30 mins prep + 1-2.5 hours wait)

### Ingredients (makes 1000g dough)

* 350ml warm water (40 deg c)
* 600 grams bread flour
* 10 grams dry instant yeast
* 5 grams honey
* 10 grams fine salt


### Prep

1. Add the honey and yeast to 200ml of the water and stir in, allow to bloom for 10 minutes and the yeast should rise to the surface as a skin.
1. Completely disolve all the salt into the remaining water.


### Method

1. Place all the flour into a mixer with a dough hook.
1. Add the yeast water in and mix on lowest setting until fully combined.
1. Slowly add the water (over a period of a few minutes) until fully combined.
1. Now switch the mixer to a medium setting and continue mixing until gluten has begun forming, the dough should have a smooth surface and come out of the bowl clean.
1. Either remove the bowl from the mixer and cover in cling film, or move the dough to another bowl and cover with cling film.
1. Allow to prove at room temp for 1-2.5 hours, until at-least doubled in size.


## Phase 2 - Forming and second prove

### Method

1. Remove the dough from the bowl and place onto a lightly oiled benchtop.
1. De-gas the dough, by means of either punching or using a forceful slap-and-fold.
1. Now portion your dough as per your mixture volume and bread tins.
1. Then make the individual pieces of dough into a oblong shapes, keeping the top free of creases, and place into your pre-greased bread tin(s).
1. Place the bread tin(s) into either a sealed (but not air-tight) container or a very loose fitting plastic bag.
1. Allow to prove again for around 1 hour, or until doubled in size (and filling out the appropriately sized bread tin).


## Phase 3 - Baking

### Method

1. Pre-heat your oven to 230c for at-least 30 minutes with a water tray.
1. Score the top of the loaf with a bakers lame (knife) as desired.
1. Quickly place the loaves into the oven and bake for around ~30 minutes.
1. Once baked, remove from the bread tin(s) and allow to cool on a rack.
