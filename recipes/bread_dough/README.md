1. Then make the individual pieces of dough into a oblong shapes, keeping the top free of creases, and place into your pre-greased bread tin(s).
1. Place the bread tin(s) into either a sealed (but not air-tight) container or a very loose fitting plastic bag.
1. Allow to prove again for around 1 hour, or until doubled in size (and filling out the appropriately sized bread tin).


## Phase 3 - Baking

1. Pre-heat your oven to 230c for at-least 30 minutes with a water tray.
