## Blender Hollandaise

#### Ingredients

* 140 grams unsalted butter (if using salted, skip salt below)
* 3 large egg yolks (no whites) - use as fresh as possible eggs
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice OR white wine vinegar


#### Method

1. In a small pot over a stove on low heat, melt the butter - do not let it get too hot or to boil.
1. In your blender, add the egg yolks, lemon juice (or vinegar) and 1/2 of the salt.
1. Blend for 30 seconds on a med-high speed, tipping the blender if required to better hit the mixture.
1. It must be blended for a full 30 seconds, until it lightens in colour, we're trying to heat the mixture.
1. Slowly add the butter into the blender while still hot and the blender is on a low speed.
1. Once all combined and the sauce thickened, taste and season with additional salt if required.
