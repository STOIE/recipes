*Multiply everything in recipe for larger batches*

### Chicken Prep

#### Ingredients

* 1kg chicken breast cut into 5mm thick slices
* 1-1/2 teaspoons backing soda (bi-carb)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon fine white pepper
* 1-1/3 tablespoons XO sauce (see recipe)
* 2 tablespoons shaoxing wine
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 3 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons corn starch
* 1/3 cup of vegetable oil
* 2/3 tablespoon of Lao Gan Ma "Chili in Oil"

#### Method

1. In a bowl add the chicken and the baking soda, mix well and allow to sit for 20 minutes.
1. Wash the chicken in a strainer to remove any remaining baking soda before proceeding to the next step.
1. Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper, then mix.
1. Mix all additional ingredients in a small bowl and then combine with the chicken mixing well.
1. Let sit for ~15+ minutes to take flavour.


### The Dish Itself

#### Ingredients

* Chicken prepared earlier
* 8 rounds of ginger (2mm thick)
* ~8-10 chopped scallions
* snow peas if wanted
* 1 whole thai chili, sliced into 0.5mm thick rounds

#### Method

1. Combine all the ingredients with the previously prepared chicken.
1. Place onto a large plate, cover tightly with aluminium foil and place into a high heat steamer.
1. If using a single very large plate that can fit all the ingredients, steam for around ~40-45 minutes (if double-stacking, cooking 2-3kg chicken, cook for ~50 minutes; over 3kg ~60 minutes).
1. Remove and eat with steamed rice.
