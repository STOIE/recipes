#### Ingredients

##### Marinade

* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 2 teaspoons oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon five spice powder
* 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 8 drops of red food colouring

##### Pork

* 1.2kg pork neck scotch fillet
* 1 tablespoon honey


#### Method

1. Combine the marinade ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to the boil. Simmer for 1 minute, then set aside to cool. Place the pork and marinade together in a ziplock bag and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or overnight if possible.
1. Remove pork from refrigerator and bring it to room temperature. Place pork on an oven rack and set it over a foil lined baking tray, reserving marinade for basting whilst cooking. Add remaining tablespoon of honey to the marinade in bag.
1. Roast pork in a preheat oven of 180C for 1 – 1¼ hours, periodically basting with the marinade during the roasting. The pork is cooked to perfection when the internal temperature reaches 68C and the juices run clear.
1. When cooked, finish pork off under the grill. Baste the pork generously with the remaining marinade and place under a hot grill for approximately 2-3 minutes or until pork is lightly charred and caramelised on the surface. Cover with foil and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
