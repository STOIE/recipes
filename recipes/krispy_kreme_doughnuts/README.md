# Dough

### Ingredients

* 2 3 teaspoons dried yeast
* 1 cup lukewarm Water
* 4+ cups all-purpose flour
* 1-1/4 cup white sugar
* 3 eggs
* 3/4 cup full-fat milk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 1/2 cup shortening



### Method: Forming the dough

1. Combine the lukewarm water and yeast in a large bowl, mixing well.
1. Combine 1 cup of all-purpose flour into the bowl.
1. Mix well, cover with a towel and set aside for five minutes to rest.
1. Heat the milk for 2 to 3 minutes, then set aside to cool until lukewarm.
1. Combine the shortening, the remaining 3 cups of all-purpose flour and the white sugar into the bowl.
1. While continuously mixing, add the eggs and milk to the bowl one-by-one, ensuring everything is mixed thoroughly.
1. Flour your workspace counter and gently knead the dough (it's be sticky, so be careful) until soft and smooth.
1. Then, place the dough back into the bowl (wash the bowl before doing so) and keep UNCOVERED for 2-3 hours at room temperature.



### Method: Shaping the doughnuts


1. Choose a round, medium-sized cookie cutter and a small, round cookie cutter (or say the wide rim of a large drinking glass).
1. Heavily flour your workspace counter and then flatten the dough with a rolling pin to 10mm thick.
1. Using your cookie cutters, cut out the shape of the doughnuts.
1. Carefully pick up each doughnut and place it on a sheet of baking paper.
1. Then, let the doughnuts rest for ten minutes on each side.



### Method: Cooking


1. Prepare a deep fryer with oil (heat until bubbles appear around the side of an inserted wooden skewer).
1. Pick up a doughnut and gently place into the fryer (adding as many as your fryer will allow, but just enough so that they won't bump and stick to each other).
1. Fry for about 5 minutes on each side, flipping them over with either purpose made tongs or a chopstick.
1. Once cooked, remove each doughnut and place them onto a rack to remove excess oil.




# Glaze

### Ingredients

* 2-1/2 cups powdered sugar
* 1/4 cup full-fat milk
* 1/4 cup corn syrup
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract



### Method


1. Combine all the ingredients in a medium sized bowl, mixing well.
1. Coat each doughnut with the glaze (immediately after frying).
1. Return each doughnut to a rack to dry for 2-3 minutes.
