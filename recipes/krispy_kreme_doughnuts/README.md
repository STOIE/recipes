# Dough

### Ingredients

* 2 3 teaspoons dried yeast
* 1 cup lukewarm Water
* 4+ cups all-purpose flour
* 1-1/4 cup white sugar
* 3 eggs
* 3/4 cup full-fat milk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 1/2 cup shortening


### Method: Forming the dough

1. Combine the lukewarm water and yeast in a large bowl, mixing well.
1. Combine 1 cup of all-purpose flour into the bowl.
1. Mix well, cover with a towel and set aside for five minutes to rest.
1. Heat the milk for 2 to 3 minutes, then set aside to cool until lukewarm.
1. Combine the shortening, the remaining 3 cups of all-purpose flour and the white sugar into the bowl.
1. While continuously mixing, add the eggs and milk to the bowl one-by-one, ensuring everything is mixed thoroughly.
1. Flour your workspace counter and gently knead the dough (it's be sticky, so be careful) until soft and smooth.
1. Then, place the dough back into the bowl (wash the bowl before doing so) and keep UNCOVERED for 2-3 hours at room temperature.


### Method: Shaping the doughnuts


1. Choose a round, medium-sized cookie cutter and a small, round cookie cutter (I ordered Mrs. Anderson's Cookie Cutters from Amazon [you can also use the wide rim of a wine glass, as I've seen on Tasty). You can create any form, shape, or size that you desire.
1. Spread a two large handfuls of all purpose flour upon your cutting board or kitchen counter. Flatten the dough with a rolling pin and use your cookie cutters or wine glass to cut out the shape of the doughnuts. If it is too flat, don't worry; it will rise once more after letting it rest for ten minutes on each side. Use the smaller cookie cutter to make a hole inside of the doughnut (don't throw the balls away! Doughnut balls are absolutely fantastic with a cinnamon sugar coating!).
1. Carefully pick up each doughnut with both hands and place it on a sheet of parchment paper. Let it rest for ten minutes on each side.


### Method: Cooking


1. Pour in five to six cups of corn oil (or any type of oil) into a large pot or pan. Use medium-high heat for this.
1. Prepare all utensils for frying. Place your strainer of any kind on a cooling rack, paper plate, or paper towel near your pan.
1. Carefully pick up a doughnut and gingerly place into the frying oil (don't just drop it in there, for it'll splash!). Add as many as your pot or pan will allow, but just enough so that they won't bump and stick to each other.
1. Fry for about five minutes on each side, flipping them over with stainless steel tongs or a chopstick (whichever works best for you).
1. Pick up each of the doughnuts and place them in the strainer. Continue to do this for each of the doughnuts.



# Glaze

### Ingredients

* 2-1/2 cups powdered sugar
* 1/4 cup full-fat milk
* 1/4 cup corn syrup
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract


### Method


1. Combine 2 to 3 cups of powdered sugar, 1/4 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of corn syrup, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract in a bowl. Mix well, and coat each doughnut with the glaze (it's best to coat them right after being fried).
1. Set them on a cooling rack to dry for two to three minutes.
