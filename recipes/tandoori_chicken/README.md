## Tandoori Chicken

### Ingredients

*Per 1kg chicken*

* 30ml lemon or lime juice (~1)
* 1/2 tablespoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon tandoori chicken colouring powder (optional)
* 1 large mild-medium green or red chilli, chopped into 1-2mm long sections
* 1/3 cup coriander leaves, finely chopped (~1/2 bunch)
* 1 tablespoon garlic paste
* 1 tablespoon ginger paste
* 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1/2 tablespoon ground coriander
* 1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
* 1/2 cup greek yoghurt
* 2 tablespoons melted ghee (or melted butter)


### Prep

1. Remove any skin from the chicken and then using a knife put slices all over the flesh of the chicken to rub the marinade into.
1. Mix the tandoori colouring into the lemon/lime juice and using gloves in large bowl, thoroughly coat all the chicken pieces.
1. Then season the chicken with the salt, and let sit while you make the next marinade.
1. Using a pestle and mortar (or blender) grind the chilli, coriander leaves, garlic and ginger to a paste.
1. Then mix the cumin, ground coriander and black pepper into the paste.
1. Next, rub the paste-marinade into the chicken thoroughly and allow to rest for 20-30 minutes.
1. After resting, add the yoghurt to the chicken, rubbing in thoroughly.
1. Now allow to rest generally overnight, but for as long as 48 hours (the longer the better).


### Cooking

1. Grill over coals, turning regularly while basting several times with the melted ghee (butter).

Note. An alternative cooking method is using an offset smoker.
