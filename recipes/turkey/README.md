# Roast Turkey

## Sous Vide Turkey

### Turkey Prep

#### Ingredients

* 4-6 kg turkey
* Kosher salt

#### Method

1. Remove any innards from the turkey.
1. Spatchcock the turkey by cutting down both sides of the spine and removing the spine entirely, then opening the bird out flat.
1. Thoroughly salt the entire turkey and then place onto a rack in the fridge, uncovered overnight.


### Sous Vide

#### Ingredients

* Turkey prepared earlier
* FoodSaver expandable vacuum bags
* 1/4 cup fresh sage leaves

#### Method

1. Prepare your large water bath and preheat to 66 degrees C - this will take probably over one hour.
1. Brush any excess salt off the turkey and place the turkey into the vacuum bag (make sure the skin side is against the smooth side of the bag).
1. Add sage leaves to the bottom side of the turkey (not skin side).
1. Seal the bag, and double bag if any sharp bones.
1. Cook in the sous vide bath for 6 hours.

Note. don't try cooking potatoes at the same time, 66 deg C is too cold and they'll never finish, potatoes need 80+ deg C.


### Finishing

#### Ingredients

* Vegetable oil

#### Method

1. Preheat oven to 260 degrees C
1. Remove turkey from the sous vide bath and place into an ice bath for 15 mins.
1. Cut open the bag, saving the juices for a gravy or stuffing.
1. Remove the turkey from the bag, discarding any leaves and place the turkey onto a wire rack over a pan to bake.
1. Brush the turkey with olive oil and then place into the oven.
1. Bake until golden brown, approx. 30 minutes.
1. Let rest for 10 minutes before carving.
