* 1 birds eye chilli
* 15-20 grams dried shrimp
* 6 candlenuts
* 4 garlic cloves
* 2 medium eschalots
* 1 stalk lemongrass
* 40mm galangal, chopped rough
* 1/2 tablespoon tumeric powder (or 40mm fresh)

#### Method

1. Add all the ingredients to a blender and blend into a paste, add water as required.
1. Freeze pre-portioned or use immediately.


### Broth

#### Ingredients

* 4 large shrimp, only the shells and heads (save the bodies for later)
* 1600ml water (7 cups)
* vegetable oil


#### Method

1. Add the shrimp shells and heads to a large pot.
1. Place on high heat, with a splash of oil.
1. Fry until fully cooked and sticking to the bottom of the pot.
1. Add the water and deglaze the pan, bringing to a rapid boil.
1. After 1 minute boiling, remove from heat.
1. Strain the liquid, disposing of the shells and setting the broth aside.


### Soup

#### Ingredients

* 6-10 tofu puffs
* 560ml coconut cream (mae ploy)
* 2 tablespoons fish sauce
* 4-6 tablespoons sugar (to taste)
* 1-2 teaspoons salt (to taste)
* vegetable oil

#### Method

1. In the pot from earlier, add the paste and some oil.
1. Fry on high heat for around 5 minutes and then add about 1/4 of the coconut cream.
1. Continue to fry, until the sticking on the pan either becomes too bad or the oil starts separating from the paste.
1. Add the remaining coconut cream and stir through, lowering the heat to medium-low.
1. Then add the shrimp broth from earlier, stirring thoroughly to combine.
1. Once simmering, lower the heat to low and add the fish sauce.
1. Then add the sugar and salt, portioning while tasting to your desire.
1. Finish by adding tofu puffs and stiring in.


### Assembly

#### Ingredients

The following ingredients are completely interchangable, but used as a guideline - served based on your liking of volumes.

* the shrimp bodies from earlier
* noodles (of your choice) - hokkien or vermicelli, or both
* fish cake, cut into 4mm slices
* imitation crab, chopped into 40mm sections
* beansprouts

#### Method

1. While the soup is still on the stove simmering (or near simmer), place a single serving of noodles into a strainer.
1. Add the strainer with the noodles to the soup and allow to cook submerged in the liquid, but kept in the strainer.
1. Once cooked, remove and add to a bowl.
1. Repeat, adding all the other ingredients to the strainer and submerging, cooking and then adding to the bowl for serving.
1. Then ladle tofu puffs and soup into the bowl, as desired (recipe should make 2 large servings).
1. Serve as is, or add vietnamese mint for garnish.
1. Repeat for other servings.
