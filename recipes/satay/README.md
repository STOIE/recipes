#### Method

1. Lightly blend the peanuts to break them up.

1. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pan and place into the sauce, be sure to leave the frypan dirty.
1. Let the mix continue to boil to a desired thickness.
1. If the sauce ever becomes "too" reduced and thick for your liking, add back more water.
1. Add the rest of sesame oil to the sauce.
1. Meanwhile, place the shallow-pan back onto highest-heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of peanut oil and onion, cooking the onion lightly so it remains crunchy.
