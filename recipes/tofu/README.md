## Firm Tofu

Servings:
Depending on what end weight you desire, multiply recipe like-for-like where initial soybean weight == final tofu weight.

#### Ingredients

* 300 grams soybeans
* 12 grams nigari powder

### Soybean preparation

1. Soak the soybeans in a large volume of water overnight (1000ml+ water for every 300 grams of soybeans)
1. The next day, drain the excess water from the soybeans and weigh them.
1. Calculate the additional volume of water required:
```
x = (initial soybean weight) multiplied by (8)
y = (final soybean weight) minus (initial soybean weight)
x minus y = additional water required.
```

### Making the Soymilk

#### Method

1. Taking the now soaked soybeans and knowing the additional water you require, split the soybeans and additional water into ratio'd batches for blending.
1. Add each batch to the blender one-by-one and blend to a milk consistency, adding the "milk" to the same (very) large pot each time.
1. Once complete, place the pot on a medium-high heat and slowly bring to a boil (bubbling), continiously stirring.
1. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let simmer for a further 10 minutes, again continiously stirring.
1. After 10 minutes, shut off the heat and over a very large bowl, add the mixture into a cheesecloth (preferably bag), catching the milk in the bowl beneath.
1. Once the original pot is empty, return the milk from the bowl to the pot.
1. Continue to squeeze out as much milk as possible from the cheesecloth (can be crushed between another bowl), placing as much milk as possible into the pot.
1. You are now left with soymilk.

### Making the Tofu

#### Method

1. Prepare your nigari powder by adding 12 grams + 50ml boiling water; per 300 inital grams soybeans - in a cup/bowl.
1. Now slowly heat the soymilk (still in the large pot) up to 73 degrees celsius.
1. Once at temperature, stop the heat and very gently stir in the nigrari liquid - stir as little as possible!
1. Cover the pot and leave for 10 minutes.
1. Meanwhile you can prepare your tofu molds on trays, lining the molds with cheesecloth.
1. After 10 minutes the milk should have coagulated into a jelly, gently remove it will a ladle and place into the molds as desired.
1. You can then fold over the cheesecloth on each mold to cover the surface and press (or not) to achieve your desired consistency.
1. Wait 10 minutes and then remove the tofu from the molds and place into a large container with fresh cold water.
1. Soak the tofu in the water for 30 minutes to remove bitterness.
1. Your tofu is now done, it can be stored in new fresh water, but replace the water daily if storing for more than 1-2 days.
