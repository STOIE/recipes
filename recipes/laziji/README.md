1. Remove the excess oil from the wok and set aside in a bowl.
1. Place about ~1/2 cup of oil back into the wok to begin frying again, bringing the wok back to temp.
1. Fry the garlic and ginger for around ~20 seconds.
1. Then, add the chicken and scallion greens into the wok and fry for about a minute - you may wish to add some more oil back in too.
1. Then, add the chillies and peanuts and stir thoroughly for ~30 seconds.
