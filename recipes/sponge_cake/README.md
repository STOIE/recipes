* 240 grams white caster sugar (in two bowls: 120g / 120g)
* 10 grams baking powder
* 3 grams salt
* 7 grams cream of tartar

#### Ingredients (two 3-inch tall = 4x 1-inch levelled cakes)

* 395 grams cake flour
* 420 grams white caster sugar (in two bowls: 210g / 210g)
* 18 grams baking powder
* 5 grams salt
* 11 grams cream of tartar
* 11 eggs (separate yolks and whites)
* 160 grams vegetable oil
* 210 grams water
* 50 grams honey
* 14 grams vanilla extract


#### Method

1. Preheat your oven to 180 celsius.
1. In your mixer bowl, add egg whites and cream of tartar.
1. Using a whisk attachment, beat on high till foamy.
1. Then add half of the sugar to the mixer bowl and continue to beat on high until firm peaks form.
1. Remove mixture from the mixing bowl and place into another large bowl.
1. Give the mixer bowl a quick clean and then add the egg yolks, the other half of the sugar, salt, baking powder, water, vegetable oil, honey and vanilla to the bowl.
1. Then add the flour to the bowl with a sieve before beating on high until fluffy, pale yellow ribbons form (ribbon, when the mixture falls onto itself a ribbon should remain for 3-4 seconds).
1. Next combine the meringue (egg whites mixture) from the other bowl into the mixture, mix through until well incorporated slowly with a gently folding motion, trying to not deflate the mixture.


#### Baking

1. Line your cake tin(s) with parchment paper along the sides and bottom.
1. Pour the mixture into the tin(s) gently and then tap the tin(s) on the benchtop twice to break any large bubbles.
1. Bake for around 45+ minutes, until golden brown with a raised centre - a wooden skewer inserted in the middle of the cake should come out dry to ensure properly cooked.
1. Once baking is complete, remove immediately from the tin and place upside down onto a cooling rack (do not attempt to flip back over).


Notes. ensure your baking powder is not out of date or too old, this can cause the cake to be deflated.
