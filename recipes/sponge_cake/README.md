1. Remove mixture from the mixing bowl and place into another large bowl.
1. Give the mixer bowl a quick clean and then add the egg yolks, the larger amount of sugar, salt, water, honey and vanilla to the bowl.
1. Beat on high until fluffy, pale yellow ribbons form (ribbon, when the mixture falls onto itself a ribbon should remain for 3-4 seconds).
1. Then add approx half of the egg white mixture into the bowl and gently fold in with a silicone spatula.
1. Using a sieve, sift the flour and baking powder into the egg yolk mixture in 3-5 parts, gently folding the mixture after each addition.
1. Next add the vegetable oil into the mixture, slowly adding while gently folding through.
1. Finally add the remaining half of the egg whites to the mixture and fold through until well combined, trying to not deflate the mixture.


#### Baking

1. Line your cake tin(s) with parchment paper along the sides and bottom.
1. Pour the mixture into the tin(s) gently and then tap the tin(s) on the benchtop twice to break any large bubbles.
1. Bake for around 45+ minutes, until you reach an internal temp of 98 deg C (do not exceed 99, and do not pull under 98).
1. Once baking is complete, place upside down on a cooling rack and DO NOT REMOVE THE TIN for 30 minutes.


Notes. ensure your baking powder is not out of date or too old, this can cause the cake to become deflated.
