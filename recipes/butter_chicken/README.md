### Gravy

#### Ingredients

* 370 grams butter (250g + 120g)
* 1200 grams tinned whole peeled tomatoes (3x 400g tins)
* 2 inches ginger rounds
* 1/2 a large garlic diced fine
* 2 large mild red chillies, cut into thin rounds
* 3 birdseye chillies, cut into thin rounds

* 3 tablespoons honey
* 16 blades whole green cardamom
* * 4 blades of mace
* 1/2 teaspoon powdered cardamom
* 1/2 teaspoon powdered kasoori methii (dried fenugreek leaves)

#### Method

1. In the now cool (but still dirty) wok, add 250g of the butter, the ginger and the chillies.
1. Then over medium heat, melt the butter and lightly fry the ginger and chilli without browning the butter.
1. Once complete remove from the wok and place to the cooked chicken in the other bowl.
1. Next take a large deep pan/pot and add the remaining 120g butter, garlic, whole cardamom and mace.
1. Place the pan over medium heat, melting the butter and lightly frying the cardamom and mace.
1. Then before browning the butter, add the tinned tomatoes.
1. Cook the mixture, stiring and smashing the tomatoes until reaching a simmer.
1. Cover and allow to cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring on and off.
1. Then remove from heat and using an immersion blender, blend the entire tomato mixture into a smooth consistency.
1. Place back on the stove, returning to a medium heat, then adding the contents of the chicken, ginger etc.
1. Cook for a further few minutes, adding in the honey and then cream.
1. Once back to a decent simmer, turn off the heat and add the powdered cardamom and kasoori methii, stiring in.
1. Finally, add salt as required - noting the mixture goes from needing salt to having too much rather abruptly. (3 teaspoons are needed generally)
1. Serve with basmati rice.
