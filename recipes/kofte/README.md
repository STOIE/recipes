# Beef

## Plain

#### Ingredients

* 1 kilogram ground beef
* 1 large onion diced very fine
* 8 cloves garlic very fine
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
* 1 teaspoon white pepper
* 2 teaspoons oregano
* 4 tablespoons ketchup
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 egg
* 2-1/2 cups bread crumbs


#### Method

Mix all the ingredients thoroughly together in a large mixing bowl.
Make the kofte rolled into a sausage shape as desired.
Then, heat a large shallow pan filled 6-8mm deep with sunflower oil.
Try a small test ball to get the temperate of the oil correct, it should be a slow simmering/boil around the beef.
Add the kofte to the pan and adjust the heat as necessary to keep the same cooking temperature (not spattering everywhere, nor doing nothing).
Keep turning as needed and remove when cooked to a plate with paper towel to soak up excess oil.
Serve hot with something like [Tzatziki](../tzatziki/).
