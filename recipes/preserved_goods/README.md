## Banana Peppers

### Ingredients

*Per 1000ml jar*

* 1.5kg banana peppers
* 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 1 teaspoon whole pepper corns
* 200ml white vinegar (1 cup)
* 100ml water (1/2 cup)

### Method

1. Chop the peppers into halves and remove the seeds/insides.
1. Grill the peppers until thoroughly charred, then bag them into a plastic bag until cool.
1. When cool, remove the skins of the peppers.
1. Place the salt and pepper corns into the jar(s).
1. Place the peppers into the jars in a vertical fashion, allowing for enough head space (3cm approx).
1. Heat in a pot til boiling the vinegar and water, while at the same time preparing the canning pot of water on the stove.
1. Fill the jars with the vinegar solution, using a chopstick to move the peppers inside back and forth to remove any air bubbles.
1. Keep refilling until no more air bubbles exist, and about 2cm of headspace over the liquid is achieved.
1. Thoroughly clean the rims of the jar(s), then place the lids on tight.
1. Place into the canning pot, and once a rolling simmer is achieved, leave for 30 minutes.
1. After 30 minutes, remove the jar(s) from the canning pot and place onto a rack to cool.
1. Immediately re-tighten the lids as much as possible.
1. As they cool, the lids should suck down and stay down once fully cooled - if not they didn't seal and will need to be refridgerated.
