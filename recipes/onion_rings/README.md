# Crispy Beer Battered

### Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
* 1 cup beer (larger or pilsner)
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 big onions (cut into 12mm rings)
* 2 tablespoons ice water (without the ice)


### Method

1. Whisk together 1 cup of flour, the 1 teaspoon of salt, white pepper, and baking powder in a large bowl.
1. Whisk in beer and ice water until combined (avoid over whisking).
1. Place remaining 1 cup of flour in a shallow dish, with another teaspoon of salt whisked through.
1. Prepare a deep fryer to temp (insert a wooden skewer and check if it bubbles).
1. Cook in batches of similar sized rings.
1. Prepare the batch by coating in the flour, then into the batter - finish the batch first.
1. Then, place the batch into the fryer (not putting too many in at once).
1. Cook until golden brown, then flip and repeat (2-4 mins).
1. Remove from the fryer and place on a rack for excess oil to drip away, meanwhile lightly salt.
1. Repeat until all are done.
1. Serve hot with a sauce (ketchup, garlic aioli, avocado aioli etc.)
