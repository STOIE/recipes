#### Ingredients

##### Dough

* 2-2/3 cups flour
* 7 grams (1 sachet) dried yeast
* 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup caster sugar
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 250ml warm water

##### Filling

* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1/3 cup oyster sauce
* 2 tablespoons Chinese cooking wine or dry sherry
* 2 teaspoons cornflour
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 300 grams of Chinese barbecue pork (char sui pork), finely chopped
* 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
* 2 teaspoons finely chopped ginger


#### Method

1. Prepare dough; sift flour, yeast, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Whisk oil, and warm water with 1½ tablespoons of the sugar in a jug until sugar dissolves. Gradually add combined water and oil to flour and stir to form a soft dough. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute until a smooth dough results. Place dough in a warm clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm draught free place for 1 hour, or until dough has doubled in size.
1. Meanwhile, prepare filling; place soy and oyster sauces, wine, remaining sugar and cornflour into a jug. Whisk to combine. Heat a wok or pot over medium-high heat. Add sesame oil, pork, garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute. Add soy mixture and cook, stirring continually for 2 minutes or until mixture boils and thickens, then set aside to cool.
1. Punch dough back and knead into a ball. Divide dough into 12 even portions. Working with 1 portion at a time, roll dough into a 12cm round. Place 1 tablespoons of mixture in the centre of each round and draw edges up to form buns. Pinch tops together to seal the bun and pinch off any excess dough to make a smooth round bun. Repeat with remaining dough and pork filling. Cut out 12 x 8cm square pieces of baking paper and place each bun with the pinched top facing down on a piece of paper.
1. Pour water into a wok or pot until it’s quarter full. Bring to the boil over high heat. Place 4 buns into a steamer and cover with lid. Cook for 15 minutes. Keep warm and repeat with remaining buns, or arrange in several bamboo steamers and stack on top of each other to cook at the same time. Serve buns steaming hot.

NOTE: The recipe makes 12 buns. Link to full recipe for Chinese barbecue pork (char sui pork) can be found [here](../chinese_bbq_pork/).
