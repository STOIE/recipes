## Massaman Beef

Note. you will need the massaman curry paste for this recipe (see the recipe for that first)

### Beef Prep

#### Ingredients

* 1kg beef (chuck or tri-tip) cut into 5cm cubes

#### Method

1. In a frying pan on high heat, add some vegetable oil and sear the beef.
1. Once seared, remove beef from the pan and set aside.
1. Add a small amount of water to the pan and deglaze the pan, set these drippings aside.


### The Dish Itself

#### Ingredients

* Beef prepared earlier
* drippings from earlier
* 2-1/2 cups coconut milk
* 5 tablespoons massaman curry paste
* 2 tablespoons fish sauce
* 3 tablespoons palm sugar, chopped
* 3 tablespoons tamarind juice
* 2 medium-large potatoes, cut into chunks
* 1 small onion cut into 1cm strips
* 1/4 cup roasted peanuts
* Jasmine rice for serving


#### Method

1. In a small pan on the stove, on medium heat, add 1/2 a cup of coconut milk and bring to a boil.
1. Add curry paste and stir to mix well. Turn heat to low, and let the mixture thicken, stirring frequently, until very thick or until coconut oil separates from the paste (this may not happen if you use canned coconut milk).
1. Move this mixture into the pressure cooker.
1. Add remaining coconut milk and stir to mix. Add seared beef, deglazed pan juices, fish sauce, palm sugar and tamarind. Stir to mix well.
1. Close pressure cooker and set it to “Pressure Cook” mode using high pressure for 30 minutes.
1. Once the timer goes off, let it cool for at least 10 minutes and then release remaining pressure.
1. Open pressure cooker, check that the beef is tender by piercing it with a fork—it should easily go through.
1. Add potato, onions, peanuts and cook again on "Pressure Cook" mode for 10 minutes.
1. Again allow 10 mins to cool after the program completes before releasing any additional pressure.
1. Open the pot and taste and adjust seasoning with more fish sauce or tamarind as needed.
1. Serve with steamed Jasmine rice.
