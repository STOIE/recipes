## Jalapeno Poppers

### Ingredients

* ~16-20 medium sized jalapeno peppers, halved and seeded
* 500 grams cream cheese, softened (2 packs)
* 250 grams cheddar cheese, grated
* 150 grams bacon, chopped into bits and fried (optional)
* 1 teaspoon black pepper, fine ground
* 250ml milk
* 1 cup plain flour
* 2 cups dry bread crumbs (whatever type you prefer)


### Method

1. Using a large mixing bowl, mix the bacon pieces into the cream cheese (if using), then add the black pepper and cheddar cheese and mix through thoroughly.
1. Using your hands and a spoon, fill the jalapeno halves, full with cheese mix (so they approach full original size, but not quite).
1. Then, setup for dredging and do a dredge in milk, then into flour on all the poppers.
1. Once complete (allowing at least 10 minutes after being flour coated), perform another dredge, but this time into milk -> bread crumbs.
1. Again, once complete (allowing another 10 minutes), perform a third dredge the same as the second, into bread crumbs.
1. At this stage poppers can be frozen to be cooked later (they can be cooked from frozen), else cooked immediately.
1. Deep fry in oil at 180 deg C, for only a few minutes until golden brown (over cooking will cause cheese to leech).
