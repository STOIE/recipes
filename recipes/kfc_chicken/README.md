#### Cooking

1. Begin heating the fryer with vegetable oil.
1. Once at temp, start cooking the chicken pieces in the fryer, don't over fill the fryer and use batches as needed.
1. Chicken pieces should float when cooked, once they start floating, give them another 2-3 minutes before removing.
1. Be sure to remove any debris left in the fryer oil after each batch is removed to avoid it burning in the oil.
1. Place cooked chicken onto a wire rack over a drip tray.
1. Repeat until all your chicken is ready and serve hot.
