### Method

#### Preparation

1. In one large bowl, add all the ingredients listed in "initial rub" (8 pieces of chicken and 1/2 tablespoon of fine table salt).
1. Mix thoroughly to coat all surfaces of the chicken evenly with the salt and then place the bowl to the side.
1. In a second large bowl, place 1 cup of plain flour as per the "first coating" and then move the bowl to the side.
1. In a thrid large bowl, place  all the ingredients from "second coating" (3 eggs, 350ml of soda water, 1/2 tablespoon of fine table salt and 1 cup of plain flour).
1. Beat together the ingredients of the batter thoroughly and then place it to the side.
1. In the fourth large bowl, add all the ingredients listed for the "third coating" and then mix together thoroughly, then place to the side.

#### Cooking

1. Begin heating the fryer with vegetable oil (to confirm that the oil is hot enough, insert a wooden skewer or wooden shopstick into the oil, it should bubble up and sizzle around the wood, if it doesn't then the oil is not yet hot enough yet).
1. While the oil is heating, prepare the chicken pieces, one at a time.
1. Take a piece of chicken and coat it thoroughly in the first coating "dry".
1. Then take the same piece and move it onto the second coating "batter", coat it thoroughly in the batter.
1. Then move it onto the third coating "seasoning" and again coat it thoroughly.
1. Then move onto the next piece and start again dry-batter-seasoning until you have all the pieces done.
1. Start cooking the chicken pieces in the fryer once it is hot enough, don't over fill the fryer and use batches as needed.
1. Cook drumsticks for 15-16 minutes and thighs for 18-20 minutes (generally cooking one type at a time).
1. Be sure to remove any debris left in the fryer oil after each batch is removed to avoid it burning in the oil.
1. Place cooked chicken onto a rack with paper towel under to catch dripping oil (don't let the towel touch the chicken or it will stick).
1. Repeat until all your chicken is ready and serve hot.
