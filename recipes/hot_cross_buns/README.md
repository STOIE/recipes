### Method

1. First, make the decorative paste by combining the flour, icing sugar, and butter in a small bowl.
1. Mix until smooth. then transfer to a piping bag and leave on the side for later (don't place in the fridge).
1. Next, make the scald by combining the flour, salt, sugar, and mixed spice in a large bowl.
1. Pour the boiling water over the ingredients and then mix together, then add the butter, raisins and candied peel (optional).
1. Mix until combined, cover and leave to cool down to between 25-28C (can be placed in fridge or freezer to speed up the process).
1. Once the temp has been reached, make the dough by first mixing in the yeast.
1. Then add the flour and mix to a dough, shaping into a single large dough ball.
1. Place the dough ball covered in the bowl and allow to rest for an hour.
1. After the first rest, remove the dough and perform a good bench fold, finally reballing and placing back into the covered bowl for another hour.
1. After the second rest, remove from the bowl and divide into 32 pieces of 87 grams each (or 48 at 58 grams each).
1. Once divided, ball and place covered on the bench to rest for 15 minutes.
1. Refold and perform a final balling, then place into the baking paper lined baking tray.
1. Take some additional melted butter (100g) and using a brush, butter between the buns to prevent them sticking together.
1. Re-cover with cling film and allow for final proof, time will depend on the temperature of the dough and the room (generally 90-120 minutes).
1. Toward the end, preheat the oven to 170C fan-forced.
1. Before placing the buns into the oven to bake, use the decorative paste and draw the crosses onto the buns.
1. Give them a spray with water and place them into the oven for around 25 minutes.
1. Before the buns are fully baked, prepare the syrup by heating the water and sugar to a boil in a small pan over the stove.
1. When you remove the buns from the oven, brush the tops of the buns with the hot sugar syrup.
1. Once removed from the pan, the hot cross buns are best eaten hot.


Notes. you can freeze your buns if they take longer than a few days to consume.
