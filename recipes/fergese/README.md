## With Feta Cheese

#### Ingredients

* 300 grams of diced beef meat (or without as you please)
* 400 grams of feta cheese diced
* 110 grams of greek yogurt
* 1 large onion diced fine
* 1 whole garlics (full size) diced fine
* 6 red banana chillies cut into small-medium sized chunks
* 2 green banana chillies cut into small-medium sized chunks (or two more reds)
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 5+ tablespoons of olive oil
* 1 tablespoon corn flour
* 1/2 tablespoon plain flour
* 2 large tomatoes (or 400 gram tin)
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* chilli (seeds or fresh) to your liking
* 2 tablespoons of red paprika
* some water


#### Method

1. In a large medium depth pan, on med heat melt 2 tablespoons of butter and mix through the plain/corn flours.
1. Add the feta to the pan and let melt all the way through.
1. Once melted, add the yogurt, mix through thoroughly and then set aside off heat.
1. In another large deep pan on high heat cook the onion and garlic within 5 tablespoons of the olive oil.
1. Then add chilli and paprika and mix through.
1. Then add meat (if using), tomatoes, banana chillies and pepper.
1. You may need to initially add a splash of water to prevent everything sticking, but keep mixing continiously until the tomatoes begin to release juice into the bottom of the pan and boiling begins.
1. Once they're stewing, reduce the heat to half and lid the pan, leave cooking until the tomatoes and chillies are near falling apart.
1. Now add the feta mix and mix everything throughly.
1. Once mixed, place the mixture into small ceramic pots about 2/3 full and add a light drizzle of olive oil to the top of each pot.
1. Place into a cold oven, turned onto 180 deg C and cook until bubbling and starting to brown ontop.
1. Remove from the oven and serve immediately (it will be very hot, but enjoyed best when hot).

#### Method

1. In a large deep pan on high heat cook the onion within the olive oil.
1. Then add meat (if using), tomatoes, chilli, pepper and salt.
1. You may need to initially add a splash of water to prevent everything sticking, but keep mixing continiously until the tomatoes begin to release juice into the bottom of the pan and boiling begins.
1. Once they're stewing, reduce the heat to half and lid the pan, leave cooking until the tomatoes are falling apart.
1. Remove this from heat into a big bowl.
1. Quickly clean the pan and then melt the butter with the garlic and fry lightly, not burning the butter.
1. Once the butter is fully melted and the garlic cooked (do not overcook it), add the red paprika, remove the pan from heat and mix it all through.
1. Return the pan to the heat and add all of the banana chillies, lower the heat and add a decent splash of water.
1. Cook on medium heat with the lid on the pan.
1. While the banana chillies are cooking, mix the corn and plain flour mix into a 1/3 of a cup of water until no lumps remain.
1. Add the flour mix into the bowl we cooked earlier (with the tomatoes +meat) and mix through.
1. Once the banana chillies are softened (not mush) turn the heat down to very low.
1. Then combine the tomato +meat mix cooked earlier into the pan and mix it through.
1. Now add the curd and mix throughly.
1. Once mixed, place the mixture into small ceramic pots about 2/3 full and add a light drizzle of olive oil to the top of each pot.
1. Place into a cold oven, turned onto 180 deg C and cook until bubbling and starting to brown ontop.
1. Remove from the oven and serve immediately (it will be very hot, but enjoyed best when hot).
