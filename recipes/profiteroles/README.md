## Profiteroles

### Choux Pastry Balls

#### Ingredients

* 150 grams unsalted butter
* 375ml water
* 225 grams AP flour
* 6 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

#### Method

1. Place the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, when mostly melted, add the water then bring to a rapid simmer.
1. While the liquid is simmering, add the flour and a pinch of salt.
1. Then stir vigorously with a wooden spoon (still on stove) until the dough forms sort of a ball and pulls away from the sides of the saucepan. About 1 minute.
1. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool for 10 minutes.
1. Preheat your oven to 200 degrees C fan-forced.
1. Line 2-3 large baking trays with baking paper.
1. Add 1 egg into batter, then beat until combined.
1. Add the remaining eggs one at a time making sure each is combined before adding the next. The dough should be like a thick paste.
1. Place the dough into a piping bag fitted with a 13 – 15mm round tip (1/2 – 3/5").
1. Pipe tablespoon sized blobs 7cm/3" apart, make around ~45 blobs.
1. Wet your finger with water and pat down any peaks to form domes (for nice round balls).
1. Bake for 15 minutes.
1. Remove from the oven and reduce the oven to 160 degrees C fan-forced.
1. They should be crispy enough that when pierced, they will not collapse – if not, return to oven for 3 additional minutes.
1. Pierce the balls with knife then return to the oven for another 5 – 7 minutes until golden and crispy.
1. Remove from the oven and transfer to rack, cool fully before filling.

### Crema Pasticcera Filling

#### Ingredients

* 560ml full-cream milk (split into 550ml / 150ml in two bowls)
* 1 long strip of lemon zest (2cm wide)
* 5 egg yolks
* 120 grams white caster sugar
* 50 grams cake flour
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

#### Method

1. Add the 550ml of milk and lemon zest to a medium saucepan.
1. Heat over medium heat until you can see steam rising from the milk, but DO NOT BOIL - then remove from heat and set aside.
1. In a bowl whish together the egg yolks, sugar and flour until smooth, then whisk in the remaining milk.
1. Remove the lemon zest from the warm milk and discard, before whisking the warm milk into the egg mixture, followed by the vanilla extract.
1. Pour all the mixture back into the saucepan and place over medium heat, whisking continuously. 
1. The mixture should boil and thicken, then simmer for 1 minute and remove from heat - do not stop stiring ever.
1. Remove the mixture into a cool bowl(s) - add any flavours at this point if using.
1. Then immediately cover the bowl(s) with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface to avoid a skin forming.
1. Refridgerate and then stir until smooth before using - can be kept in the fridge for days if making in advance.

Note. to make other flavours; chocolate, or mashed banana, or mashed blackberries etc. can be added to the hot mixture immediately after being removed from the stove before cooling.
