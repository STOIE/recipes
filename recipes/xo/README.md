## Chicken X.O.

*Multiply everything in recipe for larger batches*

### Chicken Prep

#### Ingredients

* 1kg chicken tenderloins cut into 5mm thick slices (or breast)
* 1 tablespoon baking soda (bicarbonate soda) - not baking powder!

#### Method

1. In a bowl add the chicken and the baking soda, mix well and allow to sit for 60 minutes.
1. Throughout the 60 minutes, if you remember, mix a few additional times, to ensure everything is coated well.
1. Wash the chicken in a strainer to remove any remaining baking soda.


### Sauce Prep

#### Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon fine white pepper
* 1-1/3 tablespoons XO paste (see recipe) (1 small cube per kg, or 1 big cube per 3kg)
* 2 tablespoons shaoxing wine
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 3 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons corn starch
* 1/3 cup of vegetable oil
* 2/3 tablespoon of Lao Gan Ma "Chili in Oil"

#### Method

1. Mix all the ingredients in a small/medium bowl.
1. Optional. Mix in with the chicken ahead of time, and allow to sit for any period of time, even overnight in the fridge, to take flavour.
1. Else, mix together with the chicken and use immediately.


### The Dish Itself

#### Ingredients

* Chicken prepared earlier
* 8 rounds of ginger, cut 2mm thick
* ~8-10 chopped scallions
* ~15 sugar snap peas
* 1-1/2 whole thai chili, sliced into 0.5mm thick rounds

#### Method

1. Combine all the ingredients with the previously prepared chicken.
1. Place into a large tray of adequate depth (else a plate), cover tightly with aluminium foil and place into a steamer on high heat.
1. If using a single large plate that can fit all the ingredients, steam for around ~40-45 minutes (if double-stacking, cooking 2-3kg chicken, cook for ~50 minutes; over 3kg ~60 minutes).
1. Remove and eat with steamed jasmine rice.
