# Fries

## French Fries

### Ingredients

* 4 big potatoes
* 1/2 cup corn syrup
* 1/2 cup fine white sugar
* vegetable oil for fryer
* salt to taste
* cold water


### Method

1. Wash the potatoes, skin them and then lightly square the long edges to make a rectangular block with just curved ends (avoid creating too much wastage, some curvature is fine).
1. Cut the potatoes into 5mm x 5mm fries, keep them thin or they will not cook properly!
1. Wash the cut fries in a bowl of cold water to remove excess starch, leave to soak for 5 minutes.
1. Remove from the water and dry out on paper towel (or a rack).
1. Place a large pot on the stove and add 12 cups of water, 1/2 cup of corn syrup and 1/2 a cup of fine white sugar.
1. While bringing the water to a boil, stir in and disolve all the sugars.
1. Once at a boil, turn off the heat and immediately add the fries to the water.
1. Allow to soak for 10 minutes.
1. Again, remove from the water and lay on paper towel (or a rack) to dry.
1. Place the dry fries into the freezer for 20 minutes, until very cold to the touch.
1. Heat a pot of oil on medium-high heat (or a deep fryer) till the oil bubbles when a wooden skewer is placed into it.
1. Add the fries into the hot oil and fry for only 2 minutes and no longer (this shouldn't cook then, just blanch them).
1. Remove to paper towel (or a rack) to dry and allow 15 minutes for them to cool.

At this point the fries can then be frozen, or continued cooking right away - whichever is desired.

1. Now, cook the fries in a hot deep fryer (as before) for 7 minutes.
1. Remove the cooked fries from the oil and place on paper towel (or a rack) to again dry, salt immediately after placing them down (before they dry out).
1. Serve hot.
