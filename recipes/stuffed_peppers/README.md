### Ingredients

* 400 grams ground beef
* 1.5kg red and green banana chillies
* 4 normal sized white onions diced into 6mm squares
* 1 whole medium-large garlic diced fine
* 4 medium tomates diced into 10mm cubes
* 2 cups of long grain white rice
* 2 heaped tablespoons finely diced fresh parsley
* 1 tablespoon peppermint
* 1 teaspoon fine white pepper
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 1/2 teaspoon of chilli flakes
* 9 tablespoons vegtable oil
* up to 1 litre of water


### Method

1. Wash and remove the stalks from the banana chillies and throw away.
1. Then cut the tops off and pull out the insides, placing throwing away the seeds but placing everything else to the side in a seperate bowl.
1. The internals and tops of the chillies should then be diced fine before returning them to the bowl.
1. Now place the cleaned banana chillies into a large baking tray (40-50cm round).
1. After this preparation, in a large-and-deep frypan, add 6 tablespoons of the oil and onion.
1. Fry on medium-high heat until the onion softens but is not caramelised (if you get any sticking, add 2 tablespoons of water).
1. Next, add the inners of the banana chillies that were diced earlier into the frypan with onion and also the garlic, then continue cooking lightly for another 2 minutes.
1. At this point, add the ground beef, pepper, salt, peppermint, parsley and chilli flakes.
1. Cook for around two minutes while combining the ingredients until mixed together thoroughly.
1. Now add the tomatoes to the pan and let simmer until the tomatoes begin to soften and are falling apart (if sticking occurs at any point add a splash of water).
1. Finally, add the rice and combine mixing everything together thoroughly at which point remove from the heat (the rice does not need to be cooked at all).
1. Allow the mixture to cool until able to be handled.
1. By hand, fill all the banana chillies in the tray we prepared earlier and any left over mixture, place in the tray filling gaps between any chillies.
1. Add a cup of water to the empty frypan, soaking up any juices and then drizzle it over all the chillies and mixture in the tray (the level of water in the tray should be around 2/3 of the way up the chillies [approx 2cm], if it's lower add more water, but do not overfill).
1. Drizzle the top of everything in the tray with the remaining 3 tablespoons of vegtable oil.
1. Now place the tray into a cold oven at 220 deg C and cook until the top of the chillies are browned.
1. At which point, turn all the chillies and place back into the oven to cook on the oppisite side.
1. Once the second side is browned, remove from the oven and plate to serve, hot with fresh bread.
