### Ingredients (serves 4+)

* 300 grams ground beef
* 1.5kg red and green banana chillies
* 3 normal sized white onions diced into 6mm squares
* 1 whole medium-large garlic diced fine
* 4 medium tomates diced into 10mm cubes
* 2 cups long grain white rice
* 2/3 cup finely diced fresh parsley (measured after being finely diced)
* 2 teaspoons peppermint
* 1/2 teaspoon fine white pepper
* 2-1/2 teaspoons table salt
* 2/3 teaspoon of chilli flakes
* 1-1/4 cups vegtable oil
* less than 1 litre of water


### Method

1. Wash and remove the stalks from the banana chillies and throw away.
1. Then cut the tops off and pull out the insides, placing throwing away the seeds but placing everything else to the side in a seperate bowl.
1. The internals and tops of the chillies should then be diced fine before returning them to the bowl.
1. Now place the cleaned banana chillies into a large baking tray (40+cm round).
1. After this preparation, in a large-and-deep saucepan, add 1/4 cup of the oil and onion.
1. Fry on high heat until the onion softens but is not browned or caramelised.
1. Next, add the inners of the banana chillies that were diced earlier into the frypan with onion and also the garlic, then continue cooking lightly for another 5 minutes.
1. Now add the ground beef and then tomatoes to the pan, lower the heat to medium and let simmer until the tomatoes begin to soften (around 5 minutes).
1. Add another 3/4 of a cup of oil, then the rice and combine mixing everything together thoroughly at which point turn off the heat, but keeping on the hot cooktop (the rice does not need to be cooked at all).
1. Finally, add the pepper, 2 teaspoons of salt, peppermint, parsley and chilli flakes - mixing thoroughly until combined well.
1. Now remove from the hot cooktop and allow the mixture to cool briefly until able to be handled.
1. By hand, fill all the banana chillies in the tray we prepared earlier and any left over mixture, place in the tray filling gaps between any chillies.
1. Add a cup of water to the empty frypan, soaking up any juices and then drizzle it over all the chillies and mixture in the tray (the level of water in the tray should be around 2/3 of the way up the chillies [approx 2cm], if it's lower add more water, but do not overfill).
1. Drizzle the top of everything in the tray with the remaining 4 tablespoons of vegtable oil and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
1. Now place the tray into a cold oven at 220 deg C and cook until the top of the chillies are browned.
1. At which point, turn all the chillies and place back into the oven to cook on the oppisite side.
1. Once the second side is browned, remove from the oven and plate to serve, hot with fresh bread.
