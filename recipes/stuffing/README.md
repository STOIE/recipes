# Stuffing

## Cranberry and Macadamia

#### Ingredients

* 150 grams butter
* 6 cups breadcrumbs
* 3/4 cup macadamias chopped into 1/4-1/8's and then toasted in the oven
* 1 cup dried cranberries
* 2 medium white onions finely diced (or brown onions)
* 6 eggs
* 1-1/2 cups celery diced fine, else pear diced large
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoon fresh parsley chopped fine (or 2 teaspoons dried)
* 1/2 teaspoon fine white pepper

**And, pick one or the other:**

* 1 tablespoon table salt + 3 cup of meat drippings
* 1-1/2 tablespoons chicken bouillon powder + 3 cup of water

#### Method

1. Combine everything and mix well, then place into a baking tray (or as direct stuffing).
1. If baking in a tray, be sure to avoid making the mixture too thin, 40-50mm is a good thickness.
1. Bake on 180 deg C until cooked through / browned to your liking (generally is better when not too dried out).
