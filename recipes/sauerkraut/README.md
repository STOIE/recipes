# Sauerkraut

### Ingredients

*Per 3Lt fermentation crock OR; 2x 1000ml jars*

* ~1300g whole white cabbage (~1000g trimmed/cored)
* 18 grams fine sea salt

### Method

1. Remove the outer layer from the cabbage and then chop into quarters and remove the core
1. Slice the entire cabbage against the grain into slices and place into large bowl.
1. Sprinkle the salt over the cabbage, and then using a gloved hand, massage the salt into the cabbage.
1. This is a time consuming process, do so for around 10 minutes, kneading it through.
1. The cabbage should release a lot of liquid.

#### If Using a Fermentation Crock

1. Then place the cabbage and all liquid into a clean fermentation crock.
1. Squish all the cabbage down with your knuckles and clean any that may be stuck to the sides, above the level.
1. Place the stones on top of the cabbage and then add water to the top rim of the fermenter and place the lid on.
1. After around 6-12 hours, remove the lid and press down firmly on the stones to fruther squish the cabbage.
1. If there is now enough juice to submerge the cabbage, leave it, re-lid.
1. If there is not enough juice to submerge the cabbage, create a 2% brine mixture (salt:water) and add it to the fermenter until the cabbage is just submerged, then re-lid.
1. Place into a cool dark place (18-25 deg C) and allow to ferment for ~4 weeks.

#### If Using Jars

1. Then place the cabbage and all liquid into a clean jar(s), the cabbage should sink under the liquid.
1. Tap the jar(s) to remove any air bubbles.
1. Place a sheet of cling film over the top of the jar(s) and afix with a rubber band.
1. Place into a cool dark place (18-25 deg C) and allow to ferment for ~4 weeks.
1. Every day, shake/bump the jar lightly to allow the liquid to cover the top of the cabbage.
