## Orange Chiffon Cake

## The Sponge

#### Equipment

* 10 inch chiffon cake pan
* Sieve
* Mixer


#### Ingredients

* 350 grams sifted cake flour
* 380 grams white caster sugar (in two bowls: 190g / 190g)
* 3 grams salt
* 15 grams baking powder
* 10 grams cream of tartar
* 10 grams vanilla extract
* 9 eggs (separate yolks and whites)
* 150ml vegetable oil
* 250ml freshly squeezed orange juice (3-4 oranges)
* grated peel of one orange

#### Method

1. Preheat your oven to 160 celsius.
1. In your mixer bowl, add egg whites and cream of tartar.
1. Using a whisk attachment, beat on high till foamy.
1. Then add one bowl of the sugar to the mixer bowl and continue to beat on high until firm peaks form.
1. Remove mixture from the mixing bowl and place into another large bowl.
1. Give the mixer bowl a quick clean and then add the flour, the other bowl of sugar, salt, baking powder, orange peel, orange juice, egg yolks, oil and vanilla to the bowl.
1. Beat on high until fluffy, pale yellow ribbons form (ribbon, when the mixture falls onto itself a ribbon should remain for 3-4 seconds).
1. Then add approx half of the egg white mixture into the bowl and gently fold in with a silicone spatula.
1. Finally add the remaining half of the egg whites to the mixture and fold through until well combined, trying to not deflate the mixture.

#### Baking

1. Pour the mixture into the chiffon cake pan gently and then tap the tin(s) on the benchtop twice to break any large bubbles.
1. Bake for around 70 minutes, until golden brown - a wooden skewer inserted in the middle of the cake should come out dry to ensure properly cooked.
1. Once baking is complete, remove from the oven and place upside down onto the bench to cool (the chiffon cake tin should have standoffs to support this).
1. Once cooled, remove the cake from the tin by turning it right side up and using a knife to cut around the tube and outside edges of the pan.
1. Remove the outer pan, then again with a knife cut around the bade plate of the pan and flip over on a place/rack to remove entirely.


Notes. ensure your baking powder is not out of date or too old, this can cause the cake to be deflated.
