## Tom Yum Goong (Prawn) - Creamy

#### Ingredients

* 500 grams of whole prawns
* 1000 ml water
* 2 stalks lemongrass (bottom half only)
* Small section of Galangal, cut into 10 thin rounds
* 6 Kaffir lime leaves, lightly torn
* 120 ml evapotated milk
* 3-4 cups of oyster mushrooms (or other)
* 4 tablespoons of thai chilli paste
* 3 tablespoons fish sauce
* 4 tablespoons lime juice
* Handful of coriander
* Thai chillies to taste


#### Method

1. Clean, peel and devein the prawns placing the heads and shell into a stock pot.
1. Over med-high heat saute the heads/shells until they start creating brown stick in the bottom of the pot.
1. Add the water and scrape the brown from the pan, bringing to a simmer for 15 minutes.
1. Drain the liquid from the pot through a sieve removing the heads and shells, setting the liquid aside.
1. Smash and chunk the lemongrass, then finely chop the chillies (or pound in mortar).
1. Return the stock to the pot again (now clean of shells and heads) and place back on medium heat.
1. Once simmering add the galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and chillies.
1. Simmer for 5 minutes - you may then extract all the pieces from the broth, or leave in until the end (they're not eaten).
1. Add evaporated milk and bring to boil.
1. Then, add mushrooms and boil for 2 minutes.
1. Add thai chilli paste and fish sauce, stirring to disolve.
1. Add prawns and allow to cook for only around 30 seconds, avoid over-cooking, then remove from heat.
1. After a moment to cool from the high heat, add lime juice while stirring in.
1. Stir in coriander and any salt as required.
