## Orange Chiffon Cake

## The Sponge

#### Equipment

* 10 inch chiffon cake pan
* Sieve
* Mixer


#### Ingredients

* 350 grams sifted cake flour
* 380 grams white caster sugar (in two bowls: 190g / 190g)
* 3 grams salt
* 15 grams baking powder
* 10 grams cream of tartar
* 10 grams vanilla extract
* 9 eggs (separate yolks and whites)
* 150ml vegetable oil
* 250ml freshly squeezed orange juice (3-4 oranges)
* grated peel of one orange

#### Method

1. Preheat your oven to 160 celsius.
1. In your mixer bowl, add egg whites and cream of tartar.
1. Using a whisk attachment, beat on high till foamy.
1. Then add one bowl of the sugar to the mixer bowl and continue to beat on high until firm peaks form.
1. Remove mixture from the mixing bowl and place into another large bowl.
1. Give the mixer bowl a quick clean and then add the flour, the other bowl of sugar, salt, baking powder, orange peel, orange juice, egg yolks, oil and vanilla to the bowl.
1. Beat on high until fluffy, pale yellow ribbons form (ribbon, when the mixture falls onto itself a ribbon should remain for 3-4 seconds).
1. Then add approx half of the egg white mixture into the bowl and gently fold in with a silicone spatula.
1. Finally add the remaining half of the egg whites to the mixture and fold through until well combined, trying to not deflate the mixture.

#### Baking

1. Pour the mixture into the chiffon cake pan gently and then tap the tin(s) on the benchtop twice to break any large bubbles.
1. Bake for around 70 minutes, until golden brown - a wooden skewer inserted in the middle of the cake should come out dry to ensure properly cooked.
1. Once baking is complete, remove immediately from the tin and place upside down onto the bench to cool (the chiffon cake tin should have standoffs to support this).


Notes. ensure your baking powder is not out of date or too old, this can cause the cake to be deflated.

### Crema Pasticcera

#### Ingredients

* 560ml full-cream milk (split into 550ml / 150ml in two bowls)

* 5 egg yolks

#### Method

1. Add the 550ml of milk and lemon zest to a medium saucepan.
1. Heat over medium heat until you can see steam rising from the milk, but DO NOT BOIL - then remove from heat and set aside.
1. In a bowl whish together the egg yolks, sugar and flour until smooth, then whisk in the remaining milk.
1. Remove the lemon zest from the warm milk and discard, before whisking the warm milk into the egg mixture, followed by the vanilla extract.
1. Pour all the mixture back into the saucepan and place over medium heat, whisking continuously. 
1. The mixture should boil and thicken, then simmer for 1 minute and remove from heat - do not stop stiring ever.
1. Quickly evenly divide the hot mixture into two bowls, adding the chocolate to one and stiring it through until melted and combined.
1. Then immediately cover the bowls with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface to avoid a skin forming.
1. Refridgerate and then stir until smooth before using - can be kept in the fridge if making in advance.

### Frosting and Decorating

#### Ingredients

* 500ml heavy whipping cream
* 16 grams (2 tablespoons) icing sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 150 grams (1-1/2 cups) sliced almonds

#### Method

1. Place the cream into your mixer bowl with a whisk attachment and whip on medium speed.
1. While whipping, slowly add in the sugar and vanilla extract.
1. Whip until solid peaks form, but do not over whip.
1. Refridgerate until needed.
1. Preheat your oven to 180 celsius.
1. Spread the almonds evenly over a tray lined with baking paper and place into the oven.
1. Bake for around 8 minutes until lightly browned, then remove and set aside to cool.

#### Assembly

1. Take an appropriately sized cake board.
1. Starting with the bottom layer of the cake, place it onto the board.
1. Pour the rum syrup over the layer fairly heavily to let soak in.
1. Then, apply one thick layer of the crema pasticcera to the bottom layer of the cake.
1. Next, place the second layer of the cake atop it, pressing down on the layer to make it stick to the other.
1. Now add more rum syrup, followed by another thick layer of the other colour crema pasticcera.
1. Continue to add layers and rum/crema pasticcera in alternating chocolate / white layers, until you place on the top layer of the cake - noting that if you have only 3 layers, you are already done!
1. On the top layer, add rum, but do NOT add crema pasticcera!
1. Once assembled, coat the sides and top of the cake with a thick layer of whipped cream, smoothing with a spatula.
1. Finally, apply the almonds on the outside of the cake with small throws against the cake.

Note. you can also pipe cream onto the top of the cake in any manner you desire, as well as adding cherries or more almonds to the top of the cake.
