# Classic Neapolitan Style

### Ingredients (makes ~10 medium sizes individual pizzas, ratio as required)

* 1000ml 30-deg C water
* 1.6kg plain flour 00
* 20 grams white sugar
* 50 grams table salt
* 2 grams dry yeast
* 50ml olive oil


### Method

#### Phase 1 - Mixing

1. In a large dough trough, add 1kg of the flour to the side and all the water to the other side.
1. Add the salt to the water and mix it into the water.
1. Then mix the yeast into the dry flour (NOT the water - direct contact with the salty water kills the yeast).
1. Slowly combine the flour into the water, pushing and stirring it in slowly.
1. Then continue to mix through into a sloppy dough, once it begins sticking together add the sugar sprinkled over with the other hand while still mixing.
1. Once combined, add the oil over the top of the dough mix and mix through well.
1. Then, sprinkle in, bit-by-bit the other 500-700 grams of flour (keep the dough moist, not dry).
1. Start heavily kneading on the bench top for 15-20 minutes.
1. Then let sit and rest for 20 minutes on the counter, covered with a towel.

#### Phase 2 - Cutting

1. Now we cut the dough while roughing it into baseball sized balls (the full recipe should make 9-10).
1. Now let the dough balls rest for 6-8 hours.

#### Phase 3 - Forming

1. Pre-heat the oven to the maximum temp (250 deg C+), with a flat tile inside the top half of the oven.
1. On a floured table top, take a ball at a time.
1. Try to avoid working the dough, work it as little as possible.
1. Use finger tips of both hands together like a beak, three pushes from the centre out and then flip, making a round.





Mixer hook should be as smooth as possible with no rough edges

Use cold water
Use cold poolish
Refrigerate mixer hook
Donâ€™t let dough exceed 25 degrees C

Add poolish to mixer, add all flour, mix on lowest setting
Let poolish absorb all flour
In meanwhile mix salt into cold water
Begin adding water, after a small amount, switch to 2 or 3 speed
Very slowly add water, little by little
Over course of about 12 mins mix time







When removing from mixer, place in a lightly oiled large bowl.
Form into a large ball and very lightly (with hands) oil the surface before covering with cling wrap.
Let rest 30 mins.

Cut and Ball out the dough after waiting 30 mins (oil hands first)
Place into lidded tub for 1-2 hours before using





Poolish (makes up to 2lt water in final dough, ie. 2lt+4kg flour at 50% hydration)

Add to medium mixing bowl, 300g cold water, 3g dry yeast and 3g honey.
Melt yeast and honey into water, let sit for 2-3 mins.

Then add 300g of flour to the mix and mix together.
(Use 280w flour, not too strong)

When combined cover with cling and let rest for 1hr at room temp. Then fridge for 16-24 hours.



Your final hydration is taking into account a poolish of 100% AR. (1 part water for every 1 part flour)

If need to make larger quantity, ratio up the water and flour, not the honey and yeast.
