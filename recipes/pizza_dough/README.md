# Classic Italian sSyle

### Ingredients

* 1000ml water
* 1.6kg plain flour 00
* 20 grams white sugar
* 50 grams table salt
* 2 grams dry yeast
* 50ml olive oil


### Method

#### Phase 1 - Mixing

1. In a huge bowl, add 1kg of the flour to the side and all the water to the other side.
1. Add the salt to the water and mix it into the water.
1. Then mix the yeast into the dry flour (NOT the water - direct contact with the salty water kills the yeast).
1. Slowly combine the flour into the water, pushing and stiring it in slowly.
1. Then continue to mix through into a dough, once it begins sticking together add the sugar sprinkled over with the other hand while still mixing.
1. Once combined, add the oil over the top of the dough mix.
1. Then start kneading everything together with fingers (it will still be very wet!)
1. Sprinkle in, bit by it the other 500-700 grams of flour (keep the dough moist).
1. Continue kneading for 15-20 minutes.
1. Then let sit and rest for 20 minutes on the counter, covered with a towel.

#### Phase 2 - Cutting

1. Now we cut the dough while roughing it into a baseball sized balls (the full recipe should make 9-10).
1. Now let the dough balls rest for 6-8 hours.

#### Phase 3 - Forming

1. Pre-heat the oven to the maximum temp (250 deg C+), with a flat tile inside the top half of the oven.
1. On a floured table top, take a ball at a time.
1. Try to avoid working the dough, work it as little as possible.
1. Use finger tips of both hands together like a beak, three pushes from the centre out and then flip, making a round.





# Aussie Style

### Ingredients

* 200ml water
* 2-1/2 cups plain flour
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1-3/4 teaspoons dry yeast


### Method

1. With all ingredients at room temperature, place them all into a large mixing bowl.
1. Mix all through thoroughly until a dough forms.
1. Knead dough until smooth and stretchy.
1. Halve dough into two equal parts and let sit on the counter top for 2-4 hours.

The dough can then either be used for a pizza right away, or kept in the fridge wrapped in cling wrap (or aluminium foil) over night. The dough can also be frozen, however this is not the preferred way to use it.
