# Classic Neapolitan Style (70% AR)

## Phase 1 - Poolish (15 mins prep + 30 mins wait + 16-20 hours wait)

### Ingredients (makes 6 12 inch pizzas)

* 500ml room temp water
* 500 grams flour (like Caputo Super Nuvola)
* 3 grams honey
* 3 grams dry instant yeast


### Method

1. Combine the honey into the water and mix until completely disolved.
1. Then add the instant yeast into the water mix and give a light stir.
1. In a medium-large mixing bowl, add the flour and then combine the water/honey/yeast mixture.
1. Mix very well, until all combined and minimal lumps exist.
1. Cover the bowl with cling film and allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
1. After 30 minutes, place into the firdge for a minimum of 16 hours and maximum of 20 hours before proceeding to phase 2.


## Phase 2 - Mixing (30 mins prep + 30 mins wait + 15 mins prep + 2-3 hours wait)

### Ingredients (makes 6 12 inch pizzas)

* 200ml cold water
* 500 grams flour (like Caputo Super Nuvola)
* 26 grams fine table salt


### Method

1. Combine the salt into the water and mix until fully disolved, then set aside.
1. Take the poolish mixture from the fridge and add into your (appropriate) mixer with a dough hook.
1. On a low setting, combine the additional flour into the poolish mix over 2-3 minutes.
1. Then switch the mixer to a medium speed and begin incorporating the water, slowly adding the water over an approx. 8 minute period.
1. Continue mixing on medium, checking the dough for texture every few minutes, do so by grabbing the dough ball in your finger and pulling it up, it should be a strong heavy strechy texture and not break for at-least 20-30cm, continue mixing until this is achieved.
1. Once the dough has been mixed adequately, remove from the mixer and place onto a heavily oiled benchtop (with olive oil).
1. Here use a very strong fold-slap-turn method to degas and form the dough (lift dough from one end on the bench until all in the air, then slap the dough firmly to the bench folding it over itself in the process, then pick up 90 degrees from the direction you picked it up last time).
1. Do this around 15 times and from into a large dough ball on the counter, then with very oily hands apply oil to the top of the ball.
1. Next cover in cling flim and let rest for 30 minutes.


## Phase 3 - Balling and Prove

1. After 30 minutes, cut the dough ball into 6 equal size portions and using a similar technique as before, form the dough into 6 dough balls.
1. Place the dough balls into desired proving trays or containers, covered bu not air tight.
1. Allow to prove at warm room temperature for 2-3 hours before using for pizza.




## Notes:

Mixer hook should be as smooth as possible with no rough edges
Donâ€™t let dough exceed 25 degrees C
If need to make larger quantity, ratio up the water, flour and salt in all steps, but not the honey and yeast, they remain the same at 3g.
