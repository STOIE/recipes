### Ingredients

* 200ml water
* 2-1/2 cups plain flour
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1-3/4 teaspoons dry yeast


### Method

1. With all ingredients at room temperature, place them all into a large mixing bowl.
1. Mix all through thoroughly until a dough forms.
1. Knead dough until smooth and stretchy.
1. Halve dough into two equal parts and let sit on the counter top for 2-4 hours.

The dough can then either be used for a pizza right away, or kept in the fridge wrapped in cling wrap (or aluminium foil) over night. The dough can also be frozen, however this is not the preferred way to use it.
