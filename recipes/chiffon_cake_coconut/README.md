## Coconut Chiffon Cake

## The Sponge

#### Equipment

* 10 inch chiffon cake pan
* Sieve
* Mixer


#### Ingredients

* 200 grams sifted cake flour
* 200 grams white caster sugar (in two bowls: 40g / 160g)
* 8 eggs (separate yolks and whites)
* 120ml coconut oil
* 140ml coconut milk
* 5ml lemon juice

#### Method

1. Preheat your oven to 170 celsius.
1. In your mixer bowl, add egg whites.
1. Using a whisk attachment, beat on high till foamy.
1. Then add the lemon juice and slowly incorporate the larger bowl of sugar while continuing to beat on high until firm peaks form.
1. Remove mixture from the mixing bowl and place into another large bowl.
1. Give the mixer bowl a quick clean and then add the egg yolks, the other bowl of sugar, coconut oil, coconut milk and flour to the bowl.
1. Beat on high until fluffy, pale yellow ribbons form (ribbon, when the mixture falls onto itself a ribbon should remain for 3-4 seconds).
1. Then add approx half of the egg white mixture into the bowl and gently fold in with a silicone spatula.
1. Finally add the remaining half of the egg whites to the mixture and fold through until well combined, trying to not deflate the mixture.

#### Baking

1. Pour the mixture into the chiffon cake pan gently and then tap the tin on the benchtop twice to break any large bubbles.
1. Bake for around 60 minutes, until golden brown - a wooden skewer inserted in the middle of the cake should come out dry to ensure properly cooked.
1. Once baking is complete, remove immediately from the tin and place upside down onto the bench to cool (the chiffon cake tin should have standoffs to support this).
