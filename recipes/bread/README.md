## Banh Mi

### Ingredients

*Makes 10 baguettes*

*Note. to scale up, scale yeast proportionally until reaching a max 5kg flour, then you will need to decrease the ratio of yeast.*

* 940 grams strong bread flour (12-13% protein)
* 560 grams cold water
* 14 grams instant yeast
* 4 grams salt
* 5 grams sugar
* 16 grams bread improver
* 2 whole egg (optional)

### Process

#### Mix, Knead and Rest

1. Add all ingredients, less flour to mixing bowl, then stir together.
1. Add the flour to the bowl and mix in a stand mixer with a hook attachment.
1. Allow to knead for around 5-8 minutes on high until you can pull a roughly 8inch section without tearing.
1. Now remove the dough from the mixer and place onto a lightly oiled surface, giving the dough several slap-and-folds until balling into a single ball.
1. Rest for ~20 minutes covered (cover with a bowl).

#### Ball and Rest

1. Again on the lightly oiled surface, divide into six 150g portions, reballing each.
1. Cover with cling film and allow to rest for a further ~15 minutes.

#### Shape and Proof

1. Now to shape, use a rolling pin to lightly roll into an elongated triangle shape, leaving the dough a bit thicker at the point and thinner at the base.
1. From the point, use your fingers to bit-by-bit roll and pinch down into an almost croissant shape.
1. Finish by giving a light roll with your palms over either side of the dough roll, applying pressure at only the ends to pinch them in.
1. Once shaped place onto a baguette baking pan.
1. When complete, place the baking pan into the oven with just the light on to proof, applying a mist with water every 15 minutes.

#### Bake

1. Then remove from the oven, and proof for a further 30 minutes on the bench while the oven is preheating to 235 degrees C.
1. Place a rack for the banh mi at the top of the oven and an empty steel pan on a rack below.
1. Boil a kettle with water and then score the top of each banh mi with a bakers lame, and mist with water.
1. Then place into the oven, and pour a couple of cups of boiling water into the tray below.
1. Bake for 8 minutes, after 8 minutes open the door to release steam (and remove tray if there is still excess water in it).
1. Continue to bake for another 7-8 minutes, until the crust looks to you preference.
1. Then remove from the oven and allow to cool.
