# Neapolitan Tomato Sauce

### Ingredients

* 1 kg ripe tomatoes
* 10 grams table salt
* 10 big leaves fresh basil
* Drizzle of olive oil


### Method

1. Break up the tomatoes shredding them as best you can in a mixing bowl by hand (do not blend).
1. Sieve the shredded tomatoes lightly (not forcing them into the screen), to remove excess water/juice (which can be added to a pasta sauce or similar later).
1. Add back to the mixing bowl and mix in the salt.
1. Tear apart basil leaves, adding them to the sauce.
1. Then add a drizzle of olive oil to the sauce and mix it all together.
1. Let the sauce sit for preferably an hour.
